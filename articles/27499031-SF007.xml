The '''Stuart period''' of [[English history|English]] and [[British history]] refers to the period between 1603 and 1714, while in [[Scotland]] it begins in 1371. These dates coincide with the rule of the Scottish royal [[House of Stuart]], whose first monarch to rule [[Kingdom of England|England]] was [[James I of England|James I &amp; VI]]. The death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], the last of the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]], without any descendants and without an English heir, left her two kingdoms of England and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] to be ruled by Elizabeth's closest heir, the Scottish king. The [[regicide]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] brought a temporary end to the rule of the Stuarts, when England became a [[Republic]] under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Stuarts were restored to the throne under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660. The Stuart period ended with the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of the [[House of Hanover]]. 

The Stuart era experienced many changes: the [[Gunpowder Plot]], civil and foreign wars, the regicide of a king, a republic, the great plague, the [[Great Fire of London]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]]. This was the era of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Wren|Wren]], [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Samuel Pepys|Pepys]], to name but a few. The era saw the [[British colonization of the Americas|settlement of the Americas]], trade with the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], the birth of [[steam engine]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[coffee house]]s and [[newspaper]]s.

==Flags, coins and styles (1606â1707)==

This [[James I of England|James I]] proclamation of 12 April 1606 legislated an [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of the [[Flag of England|English]] and [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish]] flags, initiating the design of the first [[Union Flag]].

{{quote|By the King: Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter.

James I was the first British monarch to use the style &quot;King of [[Great Britain]].&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;flaginstitute.org&quot;/&gt; Non-statutory use of this style is found on  [[Heraldry|heraldic]] and [[Vexillology|vexillogical]] symbolism, such as the king's [[Seal (emblem)|Great Seals]] of Office, the Royal Arms, and [[Coins|coinage]]. The style &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; (''MAGNAE BRITANNIAE REX'') appears on all Great Seals instead of the more formally correct &quot;king of England and Scotland&quot; (''ANGLIAE SCOTIAE REX'') in 1625â1627, 1640â1649, 1660â1689, and 1695â1707. The coins of James I and his successors used ''MAGNAE BRITANNIAE REX'', as seen on the [[Half crown (British coin)|half crown]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

==Lifestyles of the period==
{{Main|Social history of England}}

===Social lifestyles===
[[File:10 The Coffee House.JPG|thumb|left|155px|Stuart period: Coffee House]]
Many strictures were placed on society by the [[Puritans]]. Amongst other things, the Puritans banned gambling, [[cockfight]]s, the theatre, and even Christmas. The arrival of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] brought relief from the warlike and strict society that people had lived in for several years. The theatre returned, along with expensive fashions such as the [[periwig]]. The [[British Empire]] had been expanding since the [[Elizabethian era]], and along with much wealth returning to the country, expensive luxury items were appearing. Sugar and coffee from the [[East Indies]], tea from [[India]] and [[slavery|slave]]s from [[Africa]] were all essential items forming the backbone of trade, becoming the basis of [[London]] society. One person in nine  is estimated to have lived in London near the end of the Stuart period and, as a hub of trade, expensive goods from all over accumulated there. [[Coffee house]]s were becoming the centers of business and social life. Only coffee, tea and chocolate were served (no alcohol). Here news could be had, conversation, arguments, meetings, card games, wagers made, workmen could be paid. These products can be considered as beginning the consumer society which, while it promoted trade and brought development and riches to society, helped widen the gap between rich and poor. At the beginning of the Stuart period, [[James I of England|James I]] authorised a new translation of the Bible known as the [[King James Bible]] or Authorised Version. This was an important event in clearly separating the [[Anglican]] and [[Catholic]] churches, just as the [[Book of Common Prayer]] had done fifty years earlier. As a standard text it was also a major influence on [[English literature]], language and thought for centuries to come. [[Newspaper]]s, a fairly new invention, soon became important tools of social discourse, and [[diarist]]s such as [[Samuel Pepys]] are some of the best sources we have of everyday life in [[English Restoration|Restoration]] England.

===Political society===
[[File:Levellers' Manifest.jpg|thumb|150px|right| Levellers' Manifest of 1649]]
The Stuart period was plagued by political, internal and religious strife. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] there were two types of government: the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Both these governments were based on the rule of the same class of gentry and wealthy merchants, who had formed the majority of the electorate to Parliament before the Civil War. The old ruling class faced challenges to their position by other sections of society. The most important of these were the [[Levellers]], who wished to &quot;level&quot; society, removing [[social class|class]] distinctions to make all men equal. They wished for universal [[suffrage]] for all adult male householders, regular elections and abolition of all [[tithe]]s â which would break the power of the [[established church]].

===Public transport===

Since 1600 public carriages for hire were a feature of London life. Travel by coach was the regular public transport, which filled the road with traffic. The discarded coaches of aristocratic families, complete with their [[Heraldry|coat of arms]], were among the first [[hackney carriage]]s to ply for hire. The first hackney-carriage licences date from 1662, and applied literally to horse-drawn carriages, later modernised as [[Hansom cab]]s (1834), that operated as vehicles for hire. This public transport was first introduced to England by Captain Bailey, who standardised fares and issued licences for London Hackney Carriage. [[Road signs]] and the first [[road atlas]] by John Ogilvy further revolutionised the transport system, and standardised the mile.

*[[William Shakespeare]] (1564â1616), English poet and playwright, is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot;, producing most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the [[Elizabethian era|sixteenth century]]. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including [[Hamlet]], [[King Lear]], and [[Macbeth]], considered some of the finest works in the English language.
*[[John Speed]] (1552â1629) was a historian, best remembered as a [[cartographer]]. It was with the encouragement of [[William Camden]] that he began his ''Historie of Great Britaine'', first published in 1611. His atlas ''The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine'' was published in 1610/11, and contained the first set of individual county maps of [[England]] and [[Wales]], maps of [[Ireland]], and a general map of [[Scotland]]. Just before his death in 1627 Speed published ''A Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World,'' which was the first ''world atlas'' produced by an Englishman. In 1611, he also published ''The genealogies recorded in the [[Sacred Scriptures]] according to every family and tribe with the line of Our Savior [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] observed from [[Adam]] to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]'', a biblical [[genealogy]], reprinted several times during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Counties of Britain.

The [[English Civil War]](s), also known as the ''Wars of the Three Kingdoms'', took place in the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the second 'British' Stuart monarch. This ended in victory for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] under Oliver Cromwell, when Charles I was executed in 1649.

After this conflict the line of Stuart monarchs was temporarily displaced by the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649â1660). This was ruled directly by [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653â1659).  After Cromwell's death the Commonwealth fell apart and the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], to return from exile to become king. This is known as the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]].

==Stuart family Monarchs (1603â1714)==
The [[House of Stuart]] produced six [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] who ruled during this period. The succession of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] to the English throne in 1603, brought both the kingdoms of England and Scotland under his rule, in what was known as the [[Union of Crowns]]. Over a century later, the [[Acts of Union 1707]], passed during the reign of the last Stuart monarch, [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]], amalgamated the two kingdoms, England and Scotland, into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

{{Main|Royalist rising of 1651 to 1654}}

*1603 [[Battle of Glen Fruin]]: 400 MacGregors ambush a large number of Colquhouns, they took no prisoners and killed 140. Two days before he assumed the title King of England,  King James VI held a judicial review of the incident. The MacGregor name was banned

*1644 [[Battle of Tippermuir]]: Marching towards Perth, the Duke of Montrose was blocked by Covenanters led by Lord Elcho, who commanded the garrison at Perth. Montrose was victorious and marched into Perth, to the discomfort of local clergy.

*1645 [[Battle of Inverlochy (1645)|Battle of Inverlochy]]: The Marquis of Montrose, after his success at the Battle of Tippermuir (see below), was being pursued by a Covenanting force led by the Marquis of Argyll and his Campbell clan (though a General Baillie also though he was in command and the two men could not stand the sight of one another!). Argyll's forces amounted to 3,000 experienced Highland fighters; Montrose had about half that but they were also well trained â and included a contingent of MacDonalds who had scores to settle with the Campbells. Montrose showed his skill as a general and confused Covenanters who were subsequently routed â it is said that 1,500 Campbells and their alliers were killed that day.

*1645 [[Battle of Aldearn]]: While encamped at Auldearn, outside Nairn,  Montrose was surprised by a large force of Covenanters but fought back and defeated them. The Covenanter army lost 2,000 men that day.

*1645 [[Battle of Kilsyth]]: The Marquis of Montrose leads his royalist force of Highlanders and Irish to another victory at Kilsyth, leaving him in control of much of Scotland. In England, King Charles I was defeated at the [[Battle of Naseby]] against Cromwell.

*1650 [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]]: Oliver Cromwell advanced into Scotland, with 16,000 men, supported by ships along the east coast, in pursuit of King Charles I. The Scots army, led by David Leslie, thwarted his attempts to take the port of Leith and Cromwell retired to Dunbar. The pursuing Scottish army was badly organized for the battle, and Cromwell won not only won the battle, but was able to hold sway over most of Lowland Scotland.

*1651 [[Battle of Worcester]]: After the Royalists were defeated by Cromwell at Dunbar in 1650, Charles II was nevertheless crowned at Scone in 1651. Harried by Cromwell, the King decided to march south into England, hoping for a popular rising in his favour. He was unsuccessful and Cromwell cornered him and his army at Worcester in September. The 28,000 &quot;New Model Army&quot; overwhelmed the 16,000 Royalist forces of Cromwell.

*1666 [[Battle of Rullion Green]]: After the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the king attempted to impose his Episcopalian ideas on the Church of Scotland, replacing clergy who would not co-operate. The new ministers were not popular and in November 1666 and there was a rebellion, starting in Galloway but spreading throughout the south-west. As the Covenanters advanced towards Edinburgh they were pursued by Sir Thomas (Tam) Dalyell who fought with 1,000 of them in the Pentland Hills at Rullion Green. The rebels were overwhelmed. Some were hung, many others were transported abroad.

*1679 [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]]: 10,000+ government forces, led by Monmouth and Graham of Claverhouse, dispersed 6,000 Covenanters who had gathered at Hamilton.

*1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]]: The Jacobites, led by James Graham, Viscount Dundee, gathered at Killiecrankie. Many of the Highland clans assembled there in support of James VII, including; Cameron of Lochiel, MacLean of Duart, MacDonald, Stewart, McNeil, MacLeods and Fraser. The government forces of King William, under Hugh Mackay of Scourie, advanced through the Pass of Killiecrankie and joined battle. After a fierce conflict, government forces retreated. But the cost to the Jacobites was high, their commander, Viscount Dundee was killed by a musket shot. Just at this moment of victory, the Jacobite cause was lost as there was no-one of his stature to lead them.

*1689 [[Battle of Dunkeld]]: After the death of James Graham, Viscount Dundee, at Killiecrankie, the Jacobite army had no leader of quality. In August, 5,000 clansmen attacked Dunkeld, held by a much smaller Government force of Cameronians. They fought a determined rear-guard action through the town, killing many of the attacking Jacobites in the process. Eventually, the Jacobites withdrew and, with the onset of winter, the Highlanders dispersed. With the defeat of James VII at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland the following year, Dunkeld was the last battle in Scotland in the 17th century to restore the Stewarts to the throne.

*1690 [[Battle of the Boyne]]: Using finance and troops supplied by Louis XIV of France, James VII made a final attempt to regain his throne. He landed in Ireland where he had a large number of supporters amongst the Catholic community. King William (of Orange) personally led an army of 30,000 men, outnumbering the Jacobites. As James advanced towards Dublin, the armies met west of Drogheda, at the river Boyne. James was defeated and fled back to France.

*1715 [[Battle of Sherrifmuir]]: The Earl of Mar, leading the Jacobite forces in support of James Francis Edward Stewart (the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;), had taken control of most of Scotland north of Perth. The government forces led by the Duke of Argyll advanced from the south and the two armies met on the hills of Sherrifmuir, east of Dunblane in November 1715. After an inconclusive battle, the Jacobites withdrew. The Old Pretender arrived in Scotland (much later than expected) in December 1715 but stayed only six weeks before being persuaded to return to France. &lt;/center&gt;{{nowrap end}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
