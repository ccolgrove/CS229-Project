&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ballots for pasok presidentship elections 2007.png|thumb|left|200px|The three ballots]] --&gt;

A few hours after the results of the parliamentary elections were announced, on the night of Sunday, September 16, 2007, the leader of the defeated opposition party, George Papandreou, conceded defeat and made an announcement at PASOK's press-conference room in the Harilaos Trikoupis street building that houses the party HQ, asking all members of his party to find their own responsibilities for the defeat. He also declared that he would assume the part of the responsibility that belongs to him, by requesting the reaffirmation of his leadership by his fellow party members.

Shortly after, the winner of the elections [[Kostas Karamanlis]] gave the first post-election press conference of the winning party, [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], in the [[Zappeion]] hall, declaring victory. It must be noted that, traditionally, the Zappeion hall houses all serious political announcements in Greece.

A few minutes later, in a surprising and semantic move, Evangelos Venizelos visited the Zappeion as well, and made an announcement where he thanked all PASOK voters and party members for their effort, and stated that &quot;it is a pity that PASOK lost, while being able and obliged to win for the benefit of the country.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evenizelos.blogspot.com/2007/09/blog-post.html Transcript] from Venizelos' personal blog&lt;/ref&gt; He asked for party unity, and declared that PASOK &quot;deserves a better future and the replacement of the current false balance of power between the two parties&quot;. He thanked George Papandreou for assuming his part of the responsibility, and declared himself &quot;obviously present&quot; in the coming leadership election of his party.

On Monday, 17 September, Venizelos had a meeting with the former PASOK leader and ex-[[Prime Minister of Greece]], [[Costas Simitis]], whom he characterized as the &quot;guarantor of unity and democratic and transparent processes&quot; in his party, while he affirmed that his initiatives are not personal. Simitis, in a carefully written statement, admitted a &quot;painful defeat&quot;, prioritized party unity and supported the immediate leadership election procedures as the only means for restoration and long-term crisis avoidance in PASOK.&lt;ref name=Ant1 /&gt;

Îigh ranking PASOK officials [[Andreas Loverdos]], [[Christos Verelis]], [[George Floridis]], [[George Lianis]], [[Michalis Neonakis]],  [[Stavros Soumakis]] and [[Kimon Koulouris]] declared their support for Venizelos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megatv.com Mega News], ÎÏÎ¯ÏÎ· ÏÏÎ¿ Î ÎÎ£ÎÎ (Crisis in PASOK) Retrieved on 2007-09-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mega1 /&gt;

A survey was conducted by GPO for [[Mega channel]] on the very next day of the general elections regarding the suitability of each candidate for the party leadership. Evangelos Venizelos was regarded more suitable by 71.3% of the total sample, versus 15.8% for George Papandreou. While somewhat lower, the results were similar among PASOK voters (62.1% vs 25.7%). 70.6% considered that PASOK would achieve much better results with a different leader, while 61.2% consider that the most important factor for New Democracy's victory (among four options) was the personality of Kostas Karamanlis. Political analysts argue that the elections in Greece are becoming more of a character issue, rather than a party-orientation issue for the voters. However, 1 in 2 considered that Papandreou should still pursue the leadership, which was attributed to the necessity of selecting a better candidate among two, as opposed to Papandreou's previous election which had no opposition.&lt;ref name=Mega1&gt;[[Mega Channel]], eight o'clock News of the 2007-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several later surveys showed that the initial clear majority of Venizelos had diminished and that the election would be a close call between the two main candidates, while some of them even gave a slightly higher percentage to Papandreou.&lt;ref name=Skai.10.2007&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=62468 Skai News], Î ÏÎ¿Î²Î¬Î´Î¹ÏÎ¼Î± Î.

Other potential candidates, according to Greek media, were ex-Ministers [[Michalis Chrisohoidis]] and [[Theodoros Pangalos]] as well as the former [[EU commissioner]] [[Anna Diamantopoulou]]. The latter announced on October 1 that she would not be a candidate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=836274|publisher=in.gr|title=Î¤Î·Î½ Î±ÏÏÏÎ±ÏÎ® ÏÎ·Ï Î½Î± Î¼Î·Î½ ÎµÎ¯Î½Î±Î¹ ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ®ÏÎ¹Î± Î±Î½Î±ÎºÎ¿Î¯Î½ÏÏÎµ Î· ÎÎ½Î½Î± ÎÎ¹Î±Î¼Î±Î½ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿ÏÎ»Î¿Ï|date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pangalos followed on October 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/news/story.asp?id=1422045|title=ÎÎµÎ½ Î¸Î± ÎµÎ¯Î½Î±Î¹ ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ®ÏÎ¹Î¿Ï Î¿ Î.
