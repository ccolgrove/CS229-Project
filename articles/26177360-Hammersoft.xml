The team played in [[Arrowhead Stadium]] from 1996 to 2007 and [[CommunityAmerica Ballpark]] from 2008 to 2010. 

==History==
===Initial planning===
Originally, [[Sporting Club]], the team's ownership group, planned to move to southeast [[Kansas City, Missouri]] on land previously occupied by Bannister Mall. The redevelopment plan, called [[The Trails]], was passed on December 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/8940 As expected, City Council gives final approval to Three Trails project&lt;/ref&gt;  The last package of economic incentives, a $30-million tax rebate, was passed on November 21, 2008. 

The stadium's planned site had been demolished to prepare the site for infrastructure. It was intended to open in 2011 with a capacity of 18,500 seats. However, fallout from the 2008â2009 financial crisis placed the project on hiatus, and the stadium developer eventually sought to move the new project near the Village West retail center in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], near the [[Kansas Speedway]] and [[CommunityAmerica Ballpark]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KCK move&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/703/story/1433346.html?storylink=omni_popular |title=Wizards stadium project kicked over the state line to Wyandotte County |first=Kevin |last=Collison |publisher=''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer of The Trails complex sought additional &quot;enhancements&quot; (i.e., borrowing authority) from Kansas City to finance the building of the soccer stadium and its associated amateur soccer complex. However, the city was unwilling to provide the desired financing, leading the developer to seek a new site across the state line.{{Citation needed|date= June 2011}}

In September 2009, the developer asked [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]] and [[Kansas]] state officials for permission to use revenues from existing [[tax increment financing]] in the [[Village West]] area to help finance the soccer complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends_stadium&quot;&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/sports/wizards/story/1619544.html Kansas adjusts offer aimed at spurring Cerner, Wizards development near speedway], The Kansas City Star, December 08, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 17, Sporting KC president, Robb Heineman provided an update on the stadium situation published on team official website and blog,&lt;ref name=&quot;RHUpdate1&quot;&gt;[http://kc.wizards.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20091217&amp;content_id=7825974&amp;vkey=pr_kcw&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;team=t105 Heineman provides stadium update], KC Wizards Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RHUpdate2&quot;&gt;[http://www.hillcrestroadblog.com/2009/12/rh-stadium-update.html Hillcrest Road â RH Stadium Update], OnGoal CEO/Wizards President Robb Heineman gives an update on the progress of the stadium project.&lt;/ref&gt; basically putting the Kansas City, Kansas location as final, pending the signature of the final agreements.
