'''''Ice Station Zebra''''' is a [[1968 in film|1968]] [[action film]] directed by [[John Sturges]], starring [[Rock Hudson]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], and [[Jim Brown]]. The screenplay by [[Alistair MacLean]], [[Douglas Heyes]], [[Harry Julian Fink]], and [[W.R. Burnett]] is loosely based upon MacLean's 1963 [[Ice Station Zebra (novel)|novel of the same name]]. Both have parallels to real-life events that took place in 1959 (see below). The film was photographed in [[Super Panavision 70]] by Daniel L. Fapp, and presented in 70&amp;nbsp;mm [[Cinerama]] in premiere engagements. The original music score is by [[Michel Legrand]].

==Plot==
A [[satellite]] [[atmospheric reentry|reenters the atmosphere]] and ejects a capsule which parachutes to the [[Arctic]] (85N 21W). During an ice storm, a figure soon approaches, guided by a [[homing beacon]], while a second individual secretly watches from nearby.

The scene shifts to Commander James Ferraday ([[Rock Hudson]]), [[Captain (naval)|captain]] of the U.S. [[nuclear navy|nuclear]] [[attack submarine]] USS ''Tigerfish'' (SSN-509), stationed at [[Holy Loch]], [[Scotland]].  He is ordered by Admiral Garvey ([[Lloyd Nolan]]) to rescue the personnel of ''Drift Ice Station Zebra'', a civilian [[weather station]] moving with the [[Polar ice packs|ice pack]]. However, the mission is actually a cover for a highly classified assignment.

Ferraday welcomes aboard British [[intelligence agent]] Mr. &quot;Jones&quot; ([[Patrick McGoohan]]) and a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] platoon. While underway, a [[SH-2 Sea Sprite]] helicopter delivers Captain Anders ([[Jim Brown]]), who takes command of the Marines, and Boris Vaslov ([[Ernest Borgnine]]), an amiable Russian [[Defection|defector]] and spy and friend of Jones.

The ''Tigerfish'' makes its way under the ice to ''Zebra''âs last known position. Ferraday decides to use a [[torpedo]] to blast an opening in the thick ice. However, the [[torpedo tube]] is open at both ends and seawater floods in, plunging the sub toward its rated [[crush depth]]. Ferraday and his crew are barely able to save themselves. During the investigation of the [[torpedo tube]], Jones quickly determines that this malfunction should be impossible and, being an expert in sabotage operations, Jones even describes how someone could intentionally rig the tube to malfunction. Both Jones and Ferraday conclude that there is a [[saboteur]] aboard, and both suspect Anders, who is the one member of the rescue team who is the least known to Jones, Ferraday, and Vaslov, and universally disliked by the crew for his harsh methods. However, the mission is too important to abort.

Finally locating an area of thin ice, the sub surfaces.  Ferraday, Vaslov, Jones, and a rescue party set out for the weather station. They reach ''Zebra'' to find buildings burned down and the scientists nearly dead from [[Hypothermia|exposure]]. Jones and Vaslov begin questioning the survivors. It becomes obvious that the two spies are looking for something.

Ferraday reveals to Jones that he knows more about the mission than he is supposed to, saying &quot;We don't believe in going on a mission totally blindfolded&quot;. Having no choice, Jones reveals to Ferraday that an advanced experimental British camera was stolen by the Soviets, along with an enhanced film emulsion developed by the Americans. The Soviets sent it into orbit to find the locations of all the American [[missile silo]]s. However, the camera malfunctioned and photographed their missile sites as well. A second malfunction forced a landing in the Arctic. The scientists were caught in the crossfire between arriving Soviet and British agents.

Ferraday sets his crew to searching for the capsule. Jones eventually finds a hidden tracking device. He is ambushed and knocked unconscious by Vaslov, who turns out to be a [[double agent]]. Before Vaslov can make off with his prize, he is confronted by Anders. As the two men fight, a dazed Jones wakes up and, not having seen his assailant, shoots and kills the wrong man due to Vaslov's manipulation of the scenario.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:2593.jpg|left|thumb|Jones ([[Patrick McGoohan]]) confronts exposed double agent Vaslov ([[Ernest Borgnine]]). {{ffdc|2593.jpg|9 June 5}}]] --&gt;
Ferraday remains suspicious of Vaslov, but allows him to use the tracker to locate the capsule. They are interrupted when Russian [[paratroopers]] land at the scene. Their commander, Colonel Ostrovsky ([[Alf Kjellin]]), demands the capsule. Believing that the Americans have already secured the canister, the Russian commander threatens to activate the self-destruct mechanism with his transmitter. Ferraday stalls while Vaslov defuses the booby-trapped capsule and takes out the film. Ferraday hands over the empty container, but the deception is revealed and a brief firefight breaks out. In the confusion, Jones finds Vaslov, wounds him fatally, and retrieves the film.

Ferraday orders Jones to hand the film over to the Soviets. However, Ferraday had earlier found a device identical to Ostrovsky's. The Russians send the canister aloft by balloon to be picked up by an approaching aircraft. Lieutenant Walker makes a desperate attempt to get Ostrovsky's detonator, but fails and is wounded.  Commander Ferraday then activates his detonator, destroying the film.

Ostrovsky concedes that &quot;the incident is closed&quot; and leaves, allowing the ''Tigerfish'' to complete the rescue of the civilians. A dissolving segue shows a [[teletype machine]] churning out a news story hailing the success of the &quot;humanitarian&quot; mission as an example of [[superpower]] cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union.

===Differences from the novel===
While based on [[Alistair MacLean]]'s 1963 [[Cold War]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], the film version diverges from its source material.

The most obvious changes involved the names of the novel's characters:

* The submarine ''Dolphin'' became the ''Tigerfish''.
* The British spy Dr. Carpenter was renamed David Jones.
* Commander Swanson was changed to Commander Ferraday.

Beyond the name change, the film's submarine has a more traditionally [[GUPPY|conventional design]] similar to the first nuclear-powered submarine, the {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}}, rather than the more streamlined, teardrop-shaped vessel, either the contemporaneous [[Skipjack class submarine|''Skipjack'']] or [[Thresher/Permit class submarine|''Permit'']] design, as described in the novelâno doubt simply because that was the available design of the [[USS Ronquil (SS-396)|USS ''Ronquil'']] used to represent the fictitious ''Tigerfish'' during filming. The ''Tigerfish'' [[hull number]] 509 has [[List of submarines of the United States Navy|never been used]] for an actual US Navy submarine, although it would appear again in fiction in the 1971 television movie ''Assault on the Wayne''. 

Additional characters were added, such as [[Soviet]] [[defector]] Boris Vaslov, Marine Captain Leslie Anders, 1st Lt Russell Walker, and a [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[platoon]] trained in [[Arctic warfare]].  Much of the characterization involving the submarine's crew found in the novel was jettisoned in favor of these new cinematic creations.
Unlike the film, the novel describes little overt [[Soviet]] interest in recovering the film capsule other than a spy ship disguised as a [[Commercial trawler|fishing trawler]] waiting outside [[Holy Loch]] when the ''Tigerfish'' sets sail.

In the novel, there is no Russian submarine, no Russians on the ice, and no confrontation of any kind on the ice with the Russians.

The novel's fire on board the submarine does not occur in the film, whereas the nearly fatal flooding of the forward torpedo is common to the film and the novel.

The sabotage of the torpedo tubes is committed by a crew member in the film. In the novel, a port maintenance worker is suspected.

The film's new climax involves a [[superpower]] confrontation between [[Soviet]] [[paratrooper]]s and the American Marines, but concludes on a more ambiguous note than the novel, reflecting the perceived thaw in the Cold War following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

==Production==
The film rights to the 1963 novel were acquired the following year by producer [[Martin Ransohoff]] who hoped to capitalize on the success of the 1961 blockbuster [[The Guns of Navarone (film)|''The Guns of Navarone'']] by adapting another Alistair MacLean novel for the silver screen as a follow-up.

''Navarone'' stars [[Gregory Peck]] and [[David Niven]] were initially attached to this film, with Peck as the sub commander and Niven as the British spy, plus [[Edmond O'Brien]] and [[George Segal]] in the other key roles. Filming was set to begin in April 1965, but scheduling conflicts and U.S. Department of Defense objections over [[Paddy Chayefsky|Paddy Chayefsky's]] screenplay and its depiction of naval life onboard the submarine delayed the start.

A new script was commissioned, but due to scheduling conflicts, the original cast was no longer available when filming began in Spring 1967. Principal photography lasted nineteen weeks, ending in October 1967.  ''Ice Station Zebra'' was photographed in [[Super Panavision 70]] by Daniel L. Fapp.  The nuclear-powered ''Tigerfish'' (SSN-509) was portrayed in the movie by the [[diesel-electric]] [[GUPPY IIA|Guppy IIA]]  submarine {{USS|Ronquil|SS-396}} when seen on the surface. The underwater scenes used a model of a [[Skate class submarine|''Skate'' class]] nuclear submarine.

[[Second unit]] [[cameraman]] John M. Stephens developed an innovative underwater camera system that successfully filmed the first continuous dive of a submarine, which became the subject of the documentary featurette ''The Man Who Makes a Difference''.

Because his TV series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' was in production during principal photography in ''Ice Station Zebra'', [[Patrick McGoohan]] had the episode &quot;[[Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling]]&quot; re-written to have the mind of his character [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]] transferred into the body of another character.

== Cast ==
* [[Rock Hudson]] as Commander James Ferraday, USN
* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Boris Vaslov
* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as David Jones of [[MI6]]
* [[Jim Brown]] as Captain Leslie Anders, USMC
* [[Tony Bill]] as 1st Lieutenant Russell Walker, USMC
* [[Lloyd Nolan]] as Admiral Garvey, USN
* [[Alf Kjellin]] as Colonel Ostrovsky, the Soviet commander
* [[Gerald S. O'Loughlin]] as Lieutenant Commander Bob Raeburn, USN
* [[Ted Hartley]] as Lieutenant Jonathan Hansen, USN

== Plot origin and cultural impact==
The plot has parallels to events reported in news stories from April 1959, concerning a missing experimental [[CORONA]]  satellite capsule (Discoverer II) that inadvertently landed near [[Spitsbergen]], situated in the Arctic Ocean on April 13, which was believed to have been recovered by Soviet agents. In 2006 the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] declassified information stating that &quot;an individual formerly possessing [[CORONA]] access was the technical advisor to the movie&quot; and admitted &quot;the resemblance of the loss of the DISCOVERER II capsule, and its probable recovery by the Soviets&quot; on Spitsbergen Island, to the book by Alistair MacLean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Reconnaissance Office Review and Redaction Guide, Appendix F  | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/nro/declass.pdf page 155 | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has parallels with [[CIA]] [[Operation Coldfeet]], which took place in May/June 1962.  In this operation, two American officers parachuted from a CIA-operated [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] to an abandoned Soviet ice station.  After searching the station, they were picked up three days later by the B-17 using the [[Fulton Skyhook]] system.

Reclusive billionaire [[Howard Hughes]], who had experience both as a movie producer and a defense contractor for the [[United States Government|U.S.]], is said to have watched a private print of ''Ice Station Zebra'' 150 times on a continuous loop in his private hotel suite during the years prior to his death.{{cite}}

The sets and miniature footage from the film were re-used for the 1971 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[made-for-television movie]] ''Assault on the Wayne'', starring [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Keenan Wynn]], [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]], [[Sam Elliott]], and [[Dewey Martin (actor)|Dewey Martin]], which also featured ''Zebra'' cast members [[Lloyd Haynes]] and [[Ron Masak]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065431/&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Zebra'' comes from the representation of the [[Z|letter Z]] in the Joint Army/Navy [[spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]]. In the modern [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] later adopted by aviation and navigation, ''Zulu'' is being used instead of ''Zebra''. In actuality, there was an Ice Station ''Alpha'' (phonetic for the letter 'A') located on Ice Island T-3 in the [[Arctic]], visited by the [[USS Skate (SSN-578)|USS ''Skate'']] on 14 August 1958, as part of the [[International Geophysical Year|International Geophysical Year (IGY)'']].

Footage from ''Ice Station Zebra'' (and the model of the ''Tigerfish'') was also re-used in the [[1978 in film|1978]] [[disaster film]] ''[[Gray Lady Down]]'', the [[1983 in film|1983]] [[James Bond (films)|James Bond film]] ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', and the [[1983 in film|1983]] Cold War [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[Firefox (film)|''Firefox'']].

Sportscaster [[Chris Berman]], known for his whimsical nicknames for athletes, referred to major league [[pitcher]] [[Bob Sebra]] as &quot;Ice Station Sebra&quot;.

An episode of ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' has researchers in the Antarctic trapped on 'Ice Station Zebra'.

In the eleventh episode of the third season of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' Walter White hands Skyler a check from 'Ice Station Zebra Associates'. Ice Station Zebra is his attorney's fake company in the show.

'Ice Station Zebra' is the affectionate nickname given to [[Boundary Park]], the home of [[Oldham Athletic]], by former manager [[Joe Royle]]. This is due to its' high altitude, common cold temperatures and sense of dread and foreboding it instils in visiting [[soccer]] teams.
