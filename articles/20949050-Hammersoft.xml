In 1946 May Mill had 77,964 ring spindles, but by 1948 this had fallen to 72,984. It was re-equipped around 1950. Between 1960â1962 the mill was converted to electric ring spinning frames. The mill was eventually taken over by Courtaulds in 1962â3 to produce carpet fibre and this it continued to do until the final closure on Friday, 17th October,1980.

At the invitation of the assistant manager, Mr. Bill Crank, the Winstanleys visited May Mill in September 1980. They said
:&quot;Although we expected to see some old spinning machines, we were very surprised to find so many still in use; in fact, there was very little new machinery. Many of the machines were pre-1920, and some dated to about the turn of the century. Slubber and drawing frames were said to be part of the original May Mill equipment These were made in 1902 by [[Howard &amp; Bullough]] of Accrington. Numerous carding frames by [[Platt Brothers]] of Oldham were dated 1905, 1907 and 1920, but some of these had been converted to suit [[Courtaulds]]' needs. Fly frames, also made by Howard &amp; Bullough, were dated 1915. The scutchers made by Platt Brothers, were built in 1921 and 1924. Cone winders by [[Geo. Hattersley]] were made about 1950. Perhaps the most modern machines were ring spinning frames, dated 1967.&quot; ||&lt;!--Architect--&gt;| 1889||1980  }}

It was constructed of red Accrington brick, designed by Abraham Stott. Stott's design utilised rolled steel columns and reinforced concrete, and was unpopular when it was first proposed. The first sod was cut on 1 June 1907.

The final cost of the mill was Â£218,285. There were financial and board-room problems and the mill finally opened in August 1912. A second identical mill was proposed, but never built. There was the logo of a white hare on the mill chimney. The company was wound up in 1914. The mill was bought by William Hopwood for Â£131,450. He sold it to the newly formed Mons Mill Company Limited and the mill was renamed Mons Mill (after the [[Battle of Mons]]). There was a later company Mons Mill (1919) Limited which took over the mill in 1919.

The mill was originally powered by an engine built by [[Carel FrÃ¨res, Ghent|Carel FrÃ¨res of Belgium]] which drove about 73 belts.

In the 1950s, it was bought by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation which, in 1964,  was taken over by [[Courtaulds]]. In 1968, the mill closed. From 1971, the building was used by Ward &amp; Goldstone Limited until the 1990s when they left.

In the 1970s, the mill chimney was reduced by 30 ft. In 1986, the mill chimney and the engine house were demolished. The site was cleared in March 2000.

It's linked by a new building to Lily (No.2) mill and by a bridge to a newer building that occupies the site of Rutland mill. Signs of its cotton heritage can still be seen including its engine house with original crane system which is still largely intact.

[Watkins records:  Moston Mill, Moston, Nr Manchester.  Cotton Spinning. Intended to be a double mill eventually, Moston was built with the crankshaft, and flywheel for the full power, and provided with the bed for the other half the engine upon which the outer end of the crankshaft ran. Built by [[Carel FrÃ¨res, Ghent|Carels Brothers, Ghent]], Belgium in 1909, it was their works no 875, with cylinders 30 and 53 bore by {{Nowrap|3 ft {{frac|11|1|4}}}} in stroke. Developing 1,200&amp;nbsp;hp at 90&amp;nbsp;rpm, superheated steam 200&amp;nbsp;psi was supplied by Tetlow boilers. The flywheel, 19&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter, was provided with the sixty rope grooves that the full power would have required. The second half of the mill, however, was never completed, and in 1958 electric drives were installed, and the engine was scrapped. Typical of Continent design, six or more of Carels' engines were installed in Lancashire mills in the early 1900s.
