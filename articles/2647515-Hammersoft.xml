'''Falcon 9''' is a [[rocket engine|rocket-powered]] [[spaceflight]] [[Launch vehicle|launch system]] designed and manufactured by [[SpaceX]]. Both stages of its [[two-stage-to-orbit]] vehicle use [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) and [[RP-1|rocket-grade kerosene]] (RP-1) propellants. SpaceX plans to build several variants to lift payloads of {{convert|10450|-|26610|kg}} to [[low Earth orbit]], and {{convert|4450|-|15010|kg}} to [[geostationary transfer orbit]], which will place the Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 design in the [[Comparison of medium lift launch systems|medium-lift]] range of launch systems.

The [[Falcon 9 Flight 1|first Falcon 9 flight was launched]], after several delays, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] on June 4, 2010, at 2:45 p.m. EDT (19:45 UTC) with a successful orbital insertion.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC launch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket enjoys successful maiden flight |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10209704.stm|accessdate=2010-06-05|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second launch of the Falcon 9, and the first of the [[SpaceX Dragon]] spacecraft atop it, occurred at 10:43 EST (15:43 UTC) on December 8, 2010, from Cape Canaveral.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCLaunchDec2010&quot;&gt;BBC News. &quot;Private space capsule's maiden voyage ends with a splash.&quot; December 8, 2010. December 8, 2010. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11948329&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragon spacecraft completed two orbits, then splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFN Status&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=COTS Demo Flight 1 status|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/002/status.html|publisher=SpaceFlight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 and Dragon combination won a [[Commercial Resupply Services]] (CRS) contract from [[NASA]] to resupply the [[International Space Station]] under the [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) program.

== Design ==
[[Image:Falcon 9.svg|thumb|left|Falcon 9 (left) and [[Falcon Heavy]] (right)|120px]]
The base Falcon 9 is a two stage, [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[RP-1]] powered launch vehicle. Its first stage is powered by nine SpaceX [[Merlin (rocket engine)|Merlin 1C]] rocket engines with 556&amp;nbsp;kN (125,000&amp;nbsp;[[Pound-force|lbf]]) sea-level thrust per engine for a total thrust on liftoff of about 5.0&amp;nbsp;MN (1.1&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;lbf).&lt;ref name=sxf9o20100508&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |title=Falcon 9 Overview |date=8 May 2010 |publisher=SpaceX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Falcon 9 first stage uses a [[Pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] mixture of [[triethylaluminum]]-[[triethylborane]] (TEA-TEB) as a first-stage ignitor.&lt;ref name=sfn20100602&gt;
[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/001/status.html Mission Status Center, June 2, 2010, 1905 GMT], ''[[SpaceflightNow]]'', accessed 2010-06-02, Quotation: ''&quot;The flanges will link the rocket with ground storage tanks containing liquid oxygen, kerosene fuel, helium, gaserous nitrogen and the first stage ignitor source called triethylaluminum-triethylborane, better known as TEA-TAB.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second stage===
The upper stage is powered by a single Merlin engine modified for vacuum operation, with an [[expansion ratio]] of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345&amp;nbsp;seconds. For added reliability of restart, the engine has dual redundant pyrophoric igniters (TEA-TEB).&lt;ref name=sxf9o20100508/&gt;
SpaceX has expressed hopes that both stages will eventually be [[Reusable launch system|reusable]].&lt;ref name=nsf20090112/&gt;

The interstage, which connects the upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber aluminum core composite structure. Stage separation occurs via reusable separation [[collet]]s and a pneumatic pusher system. The Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 tank walls and domes are made from [[Al-Li|aluminum lithium alloy]]. SpaceX uses an all-[[friction stir welding|friction stir welded]] tank, the highest strength and most reliable welding technique available. The second stage tank of Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.&lt;ref name=sxf9o20100508/&gt;

=== Reliability ===
As with the company's smaller [[Falcon 1]] vehicle, Falcon 9's launch sequence includes a hold-down feature that allows full engine ignition and systems check before liftoff. After first stage engine start, the launcher is held down and not released for flight until all propulsion and vehicle systems are confirmed to be operating normally. Similar hold-down systems have been used on other launch vehicles such as the [[Saturn V]]&lt;ref&gt;NASA PAO, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4204/ch13-4.html Hold-Down Arms and Tail Service Masts], ''Moonport,'' SP-4204 (accessed 26 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Space Shuttle]]. An automatic safe shut-down and unloading of propellant occurs if any abnormal conditions are detected.&lt;ref name=sxf9o20100508/&gt;

Like the [[Saturn V]] and the unrealized [[Falcon 5]] design, the presence of multiple first stage engines allows for mission completion even if one of the first-stage engines&lt;!-- there is no engine redundancy in the second stage --&gt; fails mid-flight. This is known as &quot;engine-out capability&quot;.&lt;ref name=sxf9o20100508/&gt;
Falcon 9 is the first rocket &quot;since the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] series from the [[Apollo program]] to incorporate engine-out capability&quot;&lt;ref name=pm20090901&gt;
[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/4328638 Behind the Scenes With the World's Most Ambitious Rocket Makers], ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', 2009-09-01, accessed 2012-12-11.  ''&quot;It is the first since the Saturn series from the Apollo program to incorporate engine-out capabilityâthat is, one or more engines can fail and the rocket will still make it to orbit.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Falcon 9 has triple redundant flight computers and inertial navigation, with a GPS overlay for additional orbit insertion accuracy.&lt;ref name=sxf9o20100508/&gt;

=== Reusability ===
Although the first stage has parachutes and was intended to be recovered to demonstrate (possible future) reuse, to date SpaceX has failed to recover the stages from their initial test launches.  The stages are expendable for the initial launches.  By flight six, the first stage is intended to be recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf20090112&quot;&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/01/musk-ambition-spacex-aim-for-fully-reusable-falcon-9/ Musk ambition: SpaceX aim for fully reusable Falcon 9], ''[[NASAspaceflight.com]]'', 2009-01-12, accessed 2010-06-03&lt;/ref&gt;
Although reusability of the second stage is more difficult, SpaceX has intended both stages of the Falcon 9 to be reusable.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwEM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsey|first=Clark S|title=Interview* with Elon Musk|url=http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Interviews/Systems/ElonMusk.html|publisher=HobbySpace|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk stated:

{{quote|&quot;By [Falcon 9] flight six we think itâs highly likely weâll recover the first stage, and when we get it back weâll see what survived through re-entry, and what got fried, and carry on with the process. ...&amp;nbsp;That's just to make the first stage reusable, it'll be even harder with the second stage â which has got to have a full heatshield, it'll have to have deorbit propulsion and communication.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf20090112&quot; /&gt;}}

Both stages are covered with a layer of [[ablation|ablative]] cork, have parachutes to land them gently in the sea and have been [[marinized]] by using materials that resist salt-water corrosion, [[anodizing]] and paying attention to [[galvanic corrosion]].&lt;ref name=IwEM /&gt;

While many commentators{{Who|date=April 2011}} are skeptical about reusability, Musk has said that if the vehicle does not become reusable, &quot;I will consider us to have failed.â&lt;ref name=&quot;SpaceX P C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Simburg|first=Rand|title=SpaceX Press Conference|url=http://www.transterrestrial.com/?p=27574|accessdate=16 June 2010}}. Musk quote: âWe will never give up! Never! Reusability is one of the most important goals. If we become the biggest launch company in the world, making money hand over fist, but weâre still not reusable, I will consider us to have failed.â&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceX announced on 29th September 2011 at the National Press Club they would attempt to develop powered descent and recovery of both Falcon 9 stages â a fully vertical takeoff, vertical landing ([[VTVL]]) rocket.&lt;ref name=wp20110929&gt;
{{cite news |title=Elon Musk says SpaceX will attempt to develop fully reusable space launch vehicle |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/elon-musk-says-spacex-will-attempt-to-develop-fully-reusable-space-launch-vehicle/2011/09/29/gIQAnN9E8K_story.html |accessdate=2011-10-11 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2011-09-29 |quote=''Both of the rocketâs stages would return to the launch site and touch down vertically, under rocket power, on landing gear after delivering a spacecraft to orbit.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included was a video&lt;ref name=&quot;SpaceX Video from SpaceX.com&quot;&gt;http://www.spacex.com/assets/video/spacex-rtls-green.mp4&lt;/ref&gt; said to be an approximation depicting the first stage returning tail-first for a powered descent and the second stage, with heat shield, rentering head first before rotating for a powered descent.&lt;ref name=cspan20110929&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/Events/National-Press-Club-The-Future-of-Human-Spaceflight/10737424486/ National Press Club: The Future of Human Spaceflight], cspan, 29 Sep 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launch sites ==
There is one active launch site and two others are planned or proposed:

* [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]] is an active Falcon 9 launch site.
* SpaceX plans to lease [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpaceX P C&quot; /&gt; Conversion of the site for Falcon 9 is estimated to cost $50 million and the first launch is due in summer 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpaceX P C&quot; /&gt; {{As of|June 2010}}, Musk indicated he is confident that a Vandenberg launch pad can be ready for [[Iridium NEXT|Iridium satellite]] launches &quot;within 12 to 18 months&quot;.&lt;ref name=sdc20100616/&gt;
* SpaceX may upgrade their [[Omelek Island]] [[Falcon 1]] launch site for use by the Falcon 9; {{As of|December 2010|lc=y}}, their launch manifest gives Omelek (Kwajalein) as a possible site for several Falcon 9 launches, the first as an alternative for the [[Argentina]] [[CONAE]] mission in 2012.&lt;ref name=sxManifest20101222&gt;

== Initial descriptions ==

At an appearance in May 2004 before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]], [[Elon Musk]] testified, &quot;Long term plans call for development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand. [...] Ultimately, I believe $500 per pound [of payload delivered to orbit] or less is very achievable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=12774 |date=May 5, 2004 |title=Space Shuttle and the Future of Space Launch Vehicles |author=Testimony of Elon Musk |publisher=U.S. Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceX formally announced the Falcon 9 on 2005-09-08, describing it as being a &quot;fully reusable heavy lift launch vehicle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=http://www.spacex.com/press.php?page=18 |title=SpaceX Announces the Falcon 9 Fully Reusable Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle |date=2005-09-08 |publisher=SpaceX}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 medium{{what|date=October 2011}} was described as being capable of launching approximately {{convert|21000|lb|abbr=on}} to low Earth orbit, priced at $27&amp;nbsp;million per flight ($1286/lb).{{cn|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- need a time context on this claim, and a clearer description of the initial 2005 paper version of the rocket. --&gt;

== Production and testing ==

{{As of|December 2010}}, the Falcon 9 production line is manufacturing one new Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months. In 2012, this will double to one every six weeks.&lt;ref name=spacedotcom20101209&gt;
[http://www.space.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-ceo-interview-101208.html Q &amp; A with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk: Master of Private Space Dragons], ''[[space.com]]'', 2010-12-08, accessed 2010-12-09. &quot;now have Falcon 9 and Dragon in steady production at approximately one F9/Dragon every three months. The F9 production rate doubles to one every six weeks in 2012.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production history ===

On April 12, 2007 SpaceX announced it had completed the primary structure for its first Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 first-stage tank.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release |url=http://www.spacex.com/press.php?page=27 |title=SpaceX Completes Primary Structure of the Falcon 9 First Stage Tank |date=2007-04-11 |publisher=Space Exploration Technologies Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tank was shipped to a SpaceX test facility in Texas for first-stage static firing validation. The first multi-engine test (with two engines connected to the first stage, firing simultaneously) was successfully completed in January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press |url=http://www.spacex.com/press.php?page=35 |title=SpaceX Conducts First Multi-Engine Firing of Falcon 9 Rocket |date=18 January 2008 |publisher=SpaceX }}&lt;/ref&gt; with successive tests leading to the full Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 complement of nine engines test fired for a full mission length (178&amp;nbsp;seconds) of the first stage on November&amp;nbsp;22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |date=November 23, 2008 | url=http://www.spacex.com/press.php?page=20081123 | title = SpaceX successfully conducts full mission-length firing of its Falcon 9 launch vehicle | publisher=SpaceX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original NASA COTS contract called for the first demonstration flight of Falcon in September 2008, and completion of all three demonstration missions by September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Space Act Agreement between NASA and Space Exploration Technologies, Inc., for Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Demonstration ([http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/189228main_setc_nnj06ta26a.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; February 2008, the plan for the first Falcon 9/Dragon COTS Demo flight was delayed by six months to late in the first quarter of 2009. According to Elon Musk, the complexity of the development work and the regulatory requirements for launching from Cape Canaveral have contributed to the delay.&lt;ref&gt;

In October 2009, the first flight-ready first stage had a successful all-engine test fire at the company's test stand in McGregor,&amp;nbsp;TX. In November 2009 Space X conducted the initial second stage test firing lasting forty seconds. This test involved a new test stand and a new flight stage, and succeeded without aborts or recycles. On January 2, 2010, a full-duration (329 seconds) orbit-insertion firing of the Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 second stage was conducted at the McGregor test site{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The full stack arrived at the launch site for integration at the beginning of February 2010, and SpaceX initially scheduled a launch date of March&amp;nbsp;22, 2010, though they estimated anywhere between one and three months for integration and testing.&lt;ref name = &quot;March8&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2010/02/spacex-announces-falcon-9-assembly-underway-at-the-cape.html |title=SpaceX announces Falcon 9 assembly underway at the Cape |date=11 Feb 2010 |work=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2010 SpaceX's first flight stack was set vertical at Space Launch Complex&amp;nbsp;40, Cape Canaveral,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.spacex.com/updates.php |title= Updates |date=February 25, 2010 |work= |publisher= SpaceX | accessdate= 2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 9, SpaceX performed a static fire test, where the first stage was to be fired without taking off. Some fire and smoke were seen at the base of the rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire. However, all components checked out, but the test executed a nominal abort at T-2&amp;nbsp;seconds due to a failure in the spin-start system. This system is designed to pump high pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps to get them spinning in preparation for launch. Subsequent review showed that the failure was a valve that didn't receive a command to open. As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't occur at the McGregor test site, which didn't have the same valve setup. No damage was sustained by the vehicle or the test pad and the fire and smoke were the result of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch. All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing. A subsequent test on March&amp;nbsp;13 was successful in firing the nine first-stage engines for 3.5&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url= http://www.universetoday.com/2010/03/13/successful-engine-test-firing-for-spacex-inaugural-falcon-9/ |title= Successful Engine Test Firing for SpaceX Inaugural Falcon 9 |last=Kremer|first=Ken |date= March 13, 2010 |work= Universe Today |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delay of the first flight from March 2010 to June was due to review of the Falcon&amp;nbsp;9 [[flight termination system]] by the Air Force. On June 1, SpaceX announced on their update page that they had completed testing of the FTS and all results were nominal.

The first actual launch attempt, at 1:30pm EDT on Friday, June 4, 2010 (1730 UTC), was aborted shortly after ignition, and the rocket successfully went through a failsafe abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/04/AR2010060403360.html |title=Falcon 9 rocket launch aborted |work=Washington Post |date=June 4, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2010 | first=Marc | last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground crews were able to recycle the rocket, and successfully launched it at 2:45pm EDT (1845 UTC) the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC launch&quot;/&gt;

== Maiden Launch ==

[[File:SpaceX Falcon 9 Flight 1 launch.ogv|thumb|left|'''Launch video''' (1 min 52 secs)]]
{{Main|Falcon 9 Flight 1}}
The Falcon 9 maiden launch occurred on June 4, 2010 and was deemed a success, placing the test payload within 1 percent of the intended orbit. The second stage engine performed a short second burn to demonstrate its multiple firing capability.&lt;ref name=sfn20100604&gt;

The rocket experienced, &quot;a little bit of roll at liftoff&quot; as [[Ken Bowersox]] from SpaceX put it. This roll had stopped prior to the craft reaching the top of the tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ou3nPc0U2E&amp;playnext=1&amp;videos=Ds3RIPy51aM# Interview with Ken Bowersox from SpaceX]&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage began to slowly roll near the end of its burn which was not expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfn20100604&quot;/&gt;

The halo from the venting of propellant from the Falcon 9 rocket as it rolled in space could be seen from all of [[Eastern Australia]] and some believed it to be a [[UFO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/05/2919095.htm|title=UFO spotted over eastern Australia|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|date=June 5, 2010|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/australia-ufo-actually-private-rocket-100607.html|title='UFO' Spotted Over Australia Likely a Private Rocket|publisher=Space.com|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued development ==
[[File:SpaceX Falcon 9 launch with COTS Demo Flight 1 (low quality).ogv|thumb|SpaceX Falcon 9 launch with COTS Demo Flight 1]]
{{Main|COTS Demo Flight 1}}
The next launch attempt for Falcon 9 was COTS Demo Flight 1, with an operational Dragon module. The launch took place on December 8, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCLaunchDec2010&quot;/&gt; The flight placed the Dragon capsule in a roughly {{convert|300|km|adj=on|sp=us}} orbit. After two orbits, the capsule re-entered the atmosphere to be recovered off the coast of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFN Status&quot; /&gt;
This flight tested the pressure vessel integrity, attitude control using the Draco engines, telemetry, guidance, navigation, control systems, the PICA-X heat shield, and parachutes at speed.

== Launches and scheduled launches ==
''Note, that as of 9 July 2011, the COTS 2 and COTS 3 missions may be combined, and that no flights currently appear on the Kennedy Space Center launch manifest regarding any fall 2011 launches by Falcon 9. Waiting for official confirmation from both NASA and SpaceX on both date and mission profile for these two flights.''
