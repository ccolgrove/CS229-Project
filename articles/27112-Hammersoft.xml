The '''''Enterprise''''' or '''USS ''Enterprise''''' (often referred to as the &quot;'''Starship ''Enterprise'''''&quot;) is the name of several fictional [[starship]]s, some of which are the focal point for various television series and films in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise created by [[Gene Roddenberry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]|first=Michael|last=Okuda|authorlink=Michael Okuda|coauthors=Denise Okuda and Debbie Mirek|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|isbn=0-671-53609-5|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a name of legacy in the fleet. The majority of these vessels share &quot;NCC-1701&quot; as part of their [[Starfleet starship registry (Star Trek)|registry]], with later ships appending a letter to the registry to differentiate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt;

==''Enterprise'' history==
{{See also|Enterprise (disambiguation)#Vessels|l1=''Enterprise'' vessels}}
The name ''Enterprise'' comes from a long series of [[ship]]s. The first was the [[French frigate Entreprise|French frigate L'''Entreprise'']], captured by the British in 1705. The British rechristened the ship [[HMS Enterprise (1705)|HMS ''Enterprise'']] for use by the [[Royal Navy]]. A further nine Royal Navy commissioned warships carried the name &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The first United States ship to use the name {{USS|Enterprise|1775}} was a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]-era [[sloop-of-war]]. The seventh American ship to carry the name, the Yorktown class {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6}} is the most decorated ship in the history of the U.S. Navy, and the only Yorktown class aircraft carrier to survive World War II. The [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|eighth American ship to bear this name]] (CVN-65), was the world's first nuclear [[aircraft carrier]].

==Development==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Enterprise Sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Matt Jeffries' sketch that Gene Roddenberry approved {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
[[Image:Phase II Enterprise.jpg|thumb|Ralph McQuarrie's Redesigned Enterprise]]
According to ''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'', the registry number &quot;NCC-1701&quot; was devised by [[Matt Jefferies]], art director of the first ''Star Trek'' series, inspired by an old science fiction cover that Gene Roddenberry liked, with a starship flying through space.
Jefferies, who was a pilot, based NCC on 20th century [[aircraft registration]] codes. In such 20th century usage, an &quot;N&quot; first letter refers to an aircraft registered in the USA. A &quot;C&quot; for a second letter refers to a civil aircraft. Jefferies added a second &quot;C&quot; because he thought it looked better.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt;

The [[Franz Joseph (artist)|Franz Joseph]] ''Blueprints,'' the book ''The Making of Star Trek'' and a handful of ''Star Trek'' novels state that NCC is an [[initialism]] for &quot;Naval Construction Contract&quot;.

In Gene Roddenberry's original ''Star Trek'' pitch, the starship is described as a &quot;United Space Ship,&quot; and in two episodes of the original series (TOS), Kirk refers to the &quot;United Space Ship ''Enterprise''&quot;.

===''Star Trek: Phase II''===
Before ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', Paramount had planned a new Star Trek television series to have been named ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]''.  Early in the production, [[Ralph McQuarrie]] had been hired to redesign the ship.  The major feature of the redesign was to replace the cigar-shaped secondary hull with a larger, triangle-shaped section.  McQuarrie's design was discarded in favor of keeping the general shape of the ship intact.

Two spaceships with the name ''Enterprise'' predate the [[United Federation of Planets]].

The main setting of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (1987â1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt; During ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', the ''Enterprise'' was lost in 2371 after an attack by a renegade Klingon Bird-of-Prey (commanded by the Duras sisters) caused extensive damage, leading to a warp core breach. Although the saucer section was safely separated before the breach, the shock wave from the exploding engineering hull threw it out of control, and caused it to crash land on Veridian III.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyc&quot; /&gt; With the engineering hull destroyed and extensive damage to the saucer, the ship was deemed unsalvageable. It is most likely that Starfleet followed the dictates of its prime directive and had the saucer section removed from the surface of Veridian III. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Once we got the ship built and started putting it in environments it felt too small. The shuttle bay gave us a clear relative scale â shuttles initially appeared much bigger than we had imagined â so we bumped up the Enterprise scale, which gave her a grander feel and allowed us to include more detail.&quot;  A special feature on starships in the [[Blu-ray Disc]] (BD) version of the movie gives the length as {{convert|2379|ft}}.
