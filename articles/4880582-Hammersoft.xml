==History==
Once the [[Spanish-American War]] ended in 1898, a wing of the [[Autonomist Party (Puerto Rico)|Autonomist Party]], an old party from Spanish colonial times, founded The Republican Party on July 4, 1899.  This new party favored joining the United States as a federated state and was led by Dr. [[JosÃ© Celso Barbosa]]. The party was ideologically [[conservatism|conservative]] and was seen as representing the island's large sugar industry.

In 1924 the party split into two factions. One faction joined with the [[Union of Puerto Rico|Union Party]] to form the [[Alianza (Puerto Rico)|Alianza]] (The Alliance), a pro-autonomy group.  The other faction, renaming itself the '''Pure Republican Party''', joined with the [[Socialist Party (Puerto Rico)|Socialist Party]] to form the pro-statehood ''[[Coalition (Puerto Rico)|CoaliciÃ³n]]'' (The Coalition).

In 1932, part of the Alianza returned to the Pure Republican Party, and the party was renamed the [[Republican Union]].  The Republican Union eventually dissolved in the 1930s and  became the Puerto Rican Republican Party.

In 1967 a split in the Republican Statehood Party between leaders [[Miguel A. GarcÃ­a MÃ©ndez]] and [[Luis A. FerrÃ©]] over the 1967 status plebiscite led to the formation of the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] (NPP).  The division caused the Republican Statehood Party to be dissolved after the 1968 elections when it did not poll the number of votes necessary to retain its party registration.  The New Progressive Party went on to win the 1968 elections.

Luis FortuÃ±o was re-elected by the Republican Party of Puerto Rico's General Assembly to continue serving as National Committeeman, a position he has held since 2001. He won reelection as National Committeeman in the GOP convention held on May 20, 2007 in Yauco, Puerto Rico.


On September 4, 2008 at [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] Puerto Rico's Delegation gave all 24 votes to the party's nominee for President in the upcoming 2008 election Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona, and the party's nominee for Vice-President, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] of Alaska.

==2008 Republican Primaries==

On February 24, 2008, the Republican Party of Puerto Rico held its caucus for the 2008 Presidential Primaries.  John McCain was awarded all 24 delegates from Puerto Rico.
