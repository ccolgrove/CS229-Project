I'm thinking to myself, 'Who the hell is this guy?' So one night, we were drinking [[Corona (beer)|Coronas]] and I asked him why he had so many fans and he explained how ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful|B&amp;B]]'' was so popular around the world. I had no idea. The more he talked about it, the more I was thinking, 'I want to be on that show.'... The first time I drove into the parking lot, there was John, just pointing at me and laughing. He asked what I was doing here and I told him that I was [[Thorne Forrester|Thorne]]. That's when he told me that he was going to be playing my dad. That was just too wild.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Soap Opera Digest Insider'', September 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
