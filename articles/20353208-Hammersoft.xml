== Preseason ==
After an elite eight appearance in the [[2008 NCAA men's basketball tournament|2008 tournament]], Louisville entered the 2008â09 season ranked third in both the [[AP Poll|AP]] and [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] polls in part due to a strong recruiting class.  The incoming freshman class is ranked fifth overall by Scouts.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scouthoops.scout.com/2/701516.html |title=Scout.com 2008 Top 25 Recruiting Classes |accessdate=2008-11-22 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, led by number one ranked center [[Samardo Samuels]].

== Regular season ==
Despite the #3 preseason ranking, Louisville struggled in the non-conference losing to three unranked opponents.  After beating [[2008-09 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] on an [[Edgar Sosa (basketball)|Edgar Sosa]] [[buzzer beater|buzzer-beating]] three pointer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290040097 |title= Kentucky vs. Louisville â Recap |accessdate=2009-01-17 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Louisville entered [[Big East]] play ranked #21.  After beating [[South Florida Bulls|South Florida]] easily, Louisville beat three straight ranked teams in close games: #17 [[2008â09 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290100222 |title=Louisville vs. Villanova â Recap |accessdate=2009-01-17 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, #12 [[2008â09 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball team|Notre Dame]] in overtime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290120097 |title=Notre Dame vs. Louisville â Recap |accessdate=2009-01-17 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and previously unbeaten #1 [[2008â09 Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team|Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290170097 |title=Pittsburgh vs. Louisville â Recap |accessdate=2009-01-17 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Louisville would continue strong play, going undefeated in January and winning its first eight conference games before losing to #1 [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] on February 2.  After beating St. John's, Louisville lost by their most lopsided margin since joining the Big East, a 33-point drubbing by Notre Dame.  After that game, Louisville won its final seven regular season games to win the school's first ever regular season Big East championship.

== Big East Tournament ==
By virtue of their outright regular-season title, Louisville received a double-bye in the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] and played their first game in the tournament quarterfinals.  In the tournament, Louisville beat [[2008â09 Providence Friars men's basketball team|Providence]] 73â55 in the quarterfinals and #10 [[2008â09 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] 69â55 in the semifinals to advance to the school's first ever Big East Tournament championship game in four seasons in the conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Villanova vs. Louisville recap&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290720097 |title=Villanova vs. Louisville recap |accessdate=2009-03-13 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the finals, Louisville won its first Big East Tournament Championship, defeating #18 [[2008â09 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] 76â66.&lt;ref name=&quot;Villanova vs. Louisville recap&quot;/&gt;  Due to losses in the early conference tournament rounds by several teams above them, the Cardinals finished #1 in the final regular season AP and coaches' pollsâthe first time in school history they have been ranked #1 in either poll.

== NCAA Tournament ==
Louisville was awarded the top seed in the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Midwest Region, as well as the overall #1 seed in the tournament.  This is Louisville's second ever 1-seed.  The Cardinals beat [[Morehead State Eagles|Morehead St.]] and [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena]] in the first two tournament rounds, advancing to face [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] in the Sweet 16 on March 27.  After beating Arizona by 39 points, Louisville faced [[2008â09 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan St.]] in the Elite Eight and lost 64â52.
