Elon College was founded by the [[Christian Connection|Christian Church]], which later became a part of the [[United Church of Christ]].  The charter for Elon College was issued by the [[North Carolina legislature]] in 1889.  William S. Long was the first president, and the original student body consisted of 76 students.  In 1923, a fire destroyed most of the campus, including school records, classrooms, the library, and the chapel. The Board of Trustees voted to rebuild immediately.  Many of the buildings that were erected in the years following the fire still stand and make up the bedrock of Elon's campus.

In the early 1970s, Elon was an undergraduate college serving mainly local residents commuting from family homes,&lt;ref&gt;George Keller, ''Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction'', ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; attracting &quot;regional students of average ability from families of modest means.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''The Review of Higher Education'', http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/review_of_higher_education/v028/28.4renn.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, James Fred Young took over the presidency of Elon and dedicated himself to transforming the institution.  By the start of the 21st century, about 68 percent of Elon's students came from out-of-state and were only accepted if they met high academic standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Elon's transformation was the subject of an academic study by [[George Keller (academic)|George Keller]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] titled ''Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction''.  The study, published by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], depicted how Elon successfully transformed itself from an unimpressive college to a selective, nationally recognized university.  Keller concluded that &quot;strategic planning, financial ingenuity, faculty
dedication, and strong, determined leadership,&quot; all of which were present at Elon, can transform a higher education institution.&lt;ref&gt;George Keller, ''Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction'', ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2004), 109&lt;/ref&gt;

In transforming itself, Elon has sought to distinguish itself from conventional liberal arts colleges and conventional national universities.  According to a study by Terrence J. MacTaggart, Elon claimed &quot;to combine the best qualities of  neighboring [[Davidson College]] and [[Wake Forest University]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence J. MacTaggart, ''Academic turnarounds: restoring vitality to challenged American colleges and universities'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other schools with which the university has compared itself include [[Villanova University]], the [[College of William and Mary]], and [[Trinity College, Hartford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elon.edu/pendulum/Story.aspx?id=4533 The Pendulum - Deciding whether to be 'regional' or 'national'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elon's mission statement states that the university &quot;embraces its founders' vision of an academic community that transforms mind, body, and spirit and encourages freedom of thought and liberty of conscience,&quot; and emphasizes its commitment to &quot;nurture a rich intellectual community characterized by student engagement with a faculty dedicated to excellent teaching and scholarly accomplishment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elon.edu/e-web/about/default.xhtml About Elon University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]], former U.S. Secretaries of State General [[Colin L. Powell]] and [[Madeleine Albright]], British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Israeli War Hero Bisits Elon&quot;, ''Greensboro News and Record'', Jan 17, 2002, B2&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Elie Wiesel]], astronauts [[John Glenn]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] and network news anchors [[Brian Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elon.edu/e-net/Note.aspx?id=951802 E-Net!

[[Image:Fightiinchristian.jpg|right|thumb|130px|The Elon Fightin' Christian Emblem]]
Up until 1999, the mascot of Elon was the Fighting Christian.  The moniker is said to have been coined by a sportswriter covering a contest in the 1930s between Elon and nearby [[Guilford College]], a Quaker school. (Prior to the 1930s, Elon had been known by several different nicknames.)  The nickname was chosen due to Elon's proximity to the [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] Demon Deacons, and the [[Duke University|Duke]] Blue Devils.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}  However, many did not feel that the nickname was universal enough for a team making the transition to Division I athletics,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} so a new mascot was adopted in 1999, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]].  The choice came from the 1923 fire that destroyed almost the entire campus.  Soon after the fire, the university trustees began planning to make Elon &quot;rise from the ashes&quot;.  The Phoenix was a mythical creature that rose from the ashes of its predecessors.

Elon's Fight Song was written in 1921 by Mark Z. Rhodes to the tune of F.E. Bigelow's march &quot;Our Director.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So here's to dear old Elon&lt;br&gt;
Faithful and bold&lt;br&gt;
Here's to her banner&lt;br&gt;
Of maroon and gold&lt;br&gt;
Here's to men and women&lt;br&gt;
Who've come and gone&lt;br&gt;
Singing the victor's song&lt;br&gt;
Of old Elon&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Facilities ===
Elon's sports facilities include two gymnasiums, Walter C. Latham Baseball Park, [[Rhodes Stadium]], the on-campus [[American football|football]] stadium, a field house, six club athletic fields, a driving range and [[putting green]], and an Athletic Center.

== The Elon University Poll ==
Elon students conduct statewide polls on issues of importance to North Carolinians.

It is one of the only polls in the country that is conducted by student callers as compared to hired workers.

Polls have gauged respondents' opinions of the [[President of the United States|Presidential performance]], [[capital punishment]], and the [[Iraq War]].
