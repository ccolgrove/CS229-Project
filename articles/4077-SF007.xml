In computing, a '''binary prefix''' is a specifier or mnemonic that is prepended to the [[Units of measurement|unit]]s of digital information, the [[bit]] and the [[byte]], to indicate multiplication by a [[Exponentiation|power]] of 2. In practice the powers used are multiples of 10, so the prefixes denote powers of {{nowrap|1=1024 = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

The computer industry uses terms such as ''kilobyte'', ''megabyte'', and ''gigabyte'', and corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB, in two different ways. For example, in citations of main memory or RAM capacity,  ''gigabyte'' customarily means {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} bytes. This is a [[power of 2]], specifically 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore this usage is referred to as a binary unit or binary prefix.

In most other contexts, the industry uses ''kilo'', ''mega'', ''giga'', etc., in a manner consistent with their meaning in the [[International System of Units]] (SI): as powers of 1000.  For example, a 500 gigabyte hard drive holds {{gaps|500|000|000|000}} bytes, and a 100 megabit per second Ethernet connection transfers data at {{gaps|100|000|000}} bit/s.

Starting in about 1998, a number of standards and trade organizations approved standards and recommendations for a new set of binary prefixes, proposed earlier by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), that would refer unambiguously to powers of 1024.
According to these, the [[SI prefix]]es would only be used in the decimal sense, even when referring to data storage capacities: [[kilobyte]] and [[megabyte]] would denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as [[kibibyte]], [[mebibyte]] and [[gibibyte]],
abbreviated KiB, MiB, and GiB, would denote 1024 bytes, {{gaps|1|048|576}} bytes, and {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} bytes respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST-biprefix&quot;/&gt; However, as of 2011 adoption has been slow and usage has been limited in the marketplace and in the press.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of binary prefixes}}

===Main memory===
Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base-2) or decimal (base-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|quote = Of 187 different relevant systems, 131 utilize a straight binary system internally, whereas 53 utilize the decimal system (primarily binary coded decimal) and 3 systems utilize a binary coded alphanumeric system of notation.

}} This lengthy report describes many of the early computers.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the [[IBM 701]] (1952) used binary and could address 2048 36-[[bit]] [[Word (data type)|words]], while the [[IBM 702]] (1953) used decimal and could address {{gaps|10|000}} 7-bit words.

By the mid 1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two. This is the most natural configuration for memory, as all combinations of their address lines map to a valid address, allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.

Early computer system documentation would specify the memory size with an exact number such as 4096, 8192, or 16384 words of storage. These are all [[powers of 2]], and furthermore are small multiples of 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;,
or 1024. As storage capacities increased, several different methods were developed to abbreviate these quantities.

The method most commonly used today uses  prefixes such as  kilo, mega, giga, and corresponding symbols K, M, and G, 
which the computer industry originally adopted from the [[metric system]]. The prefixes ''kilo-'' and ''mega-'', meaning 1000 and {{gaps|1|000|000}} respectively, were commonly used in the electronics industry before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunting Trouble on 28 Megacycles, A. L. Blais, QST, January 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Along with ''giga-'' or G-, meaning  {{gaps|1|000|000|000}}, they are now known as [[SI prefixes]]&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt; after the [[International System of Units]] (SI), introduced in 1960 to formalize aspects of the metric system, although K is the SI unit for temperature ([[kelvin]]) and should not be mixed up with k, the SI prefix for [[Kilo-|kilo]].

The International System of Units does not define units for digital information but notes that the SI prefixes may be applied outside the contexts where base units or derived units would be used. But as computer main memory in a binary-addressed system is manufactured in sizes that were easily expressed as multiples of 1024, ''kilobyte'', when applied to computer memory, came to be used to mean 1024 bytes instead of 1000.  (SI explicitly prohibits this usage, stating that the prefixes ''only'' have the 1000-based meaning, and cannot be used as placeholders for other numbers, like 
1024.)&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of K in the binary sense as in a &quot;32K core&quot; meaning 32Ã1024, or {{gaps|32|768}}, can be found as early as 1959.&lt;ref

The &quot;truncation&quot; method gradually waned. Capitalization of the letter K became the ''de facto'' standard for binary notation, although this could not be extended to higher powers. Nevertheless, the practice of using the SI-inspired &quot;kilo&quot; to indicate 1024 was later extended to &quot;megabyte&quot; meaning 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ({{gaps|1|048|576}}) bytes, and later &quot;gigabyte&quot; for 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ({{gaps|1|073|741|824}}) bytes. For example, a &quot;512&amp;nbsp;megabyte&quot; RAM module is 512Ã1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes (512Ã{{gaps|1|048|576}}, or {{gaps|536|870|912}}), rather than {{gaps|512|000|000}}.

The symbols Kbit, Kbyte, Mbit and Mbyte started to be used as &quot;binary units&quot;â&quot;bit&quot; or &quot;byte&quot; with a multiplier that is a power of 1024âin the early 1970s.&lt;ref

For a time, memory capacities were often expressed in K, even when M could have been used: The IBM System/370 Model 158 brochure (1972) had the following: &quot;Real storage capacity is available in 512K increments ranging from 512K to 2,048K bytes.&quot;&lt;ref

===Disk drives===
The disk drive industry followed a different pattern. Industry practice, more thoroughly documented at [[Timeline of binary prefixes]] and continuing today, is to specify hard drives using SI prefixes and symbols in their SI or &quot;decimal&quot; interpretation. Unlike binary-addressed computer main memory, there is nothing in a disk drive that influences it to have a total capacity easily expressed using a power of 1024. The first commercially sold disk drive, the [[IBM 350]], had 50 (not 32 or 64) physical disk &quot;platters&quot; containing a total of 50,000 sectors of 100 characters each, for a total quoted capacity of &quot;5 million characters.&quot;&lt;ref
&quot;name=ibm350&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html
|work=IBM Archives
|title=IBM 350 disk storage unit
|author=IBM Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in September 1956.

In the 1960s most disk drives used IBM's variable block length format (called [[Count Key Data]] or &quot;CKD&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;IBM invented the disk drive in 1956 and until the late 1960s its drives and their clones were dominant. See, e.g. [http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/1980.htm US vs. IBM antitrust litigation (Jan 1969)], especially IBM analyses of Memorex and other disk drive companies.&lt;/ref&gt;
Any block size could be specified up to the maximum track length.  Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size.  Blocks (&quot;records&quot; in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100 megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.  

Hard disk drive manufacturers used &quot;megabytes&quot; or &quot;MB&quot;, meaning 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, to characterize their products as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/discs/brochures/ProductLine_Oct74.pdf CDC Product Line Card] unambiguously uses MB to characterize HDD capacity in millions of bytes&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1977, in its first edition, Disk/Trend, a leading hard disk drive industry marketing consultancy segmented the industry according to MBs (decimal sense) of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;1977 Disk/Trend Report â Rigid Disk Drives, published June 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest hard disk drives in personal computing history,
the Seagate [[ST-412]], was specified as &quot;Formatted: 10.0 Megabytes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ST506/412 OEM Manual, Seagate Corp. April 1982, para. 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The specification of 4 heads or active surfaces (tracks per cylinder), 306  cylinders and when formatted with a sector size of 256 bytes and 32 sectors/track results in a capacity of {{gaps|10|027|008}} bytes. With the customary binary prefixes,&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.cbp&quot;/&gt; this would be expressed as 9.5625 megabytes. This drive was one of several types installed into the [[IBM PC/XT]] &lt;ref&gt;IBM Tells MiniScribe It Is Cutting Back On Winchester Orders, Computer System News, Jan 1, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively advertised and reported as a &quot;10 MB&quot; (formatted) hard disk drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/06/oldest_seagate_drive_in_uk/ It's the oldest working Seagate drive in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hard drive industry continues to use decimal prefixes for drive capacity. Today, for example, a &quot;300&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; hard drive offers slightly more than 300Ã10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, or {{gaps|300|000|000|000}}, bytes, not 300Ã2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; (which would be about 322Ã10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;).  Operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]] that display hard drive sizes using the customary binary prefix &quot;GB&quot; (as it is used for RAM) would display this as 279.4&amp;nbsp;GB (meaning 279.4Ã1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 279.4Ã{{gaps|1|073|741|824}}).  

However, other usages still occur. For example, in one document, Seagate specifies data transfer rates of some of its hard drives in ''both'' IEC and decimal units.&lt;ref name=savvio&gt;
[http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/docs/manual/enterprise/savvio/10K.5/100628561d.pdf Seagate Savvio 10K.5 SAS Product Manual], 100628561, Rev D, March 2011, sec 5.2.3, p. 10 (18th page of the pdf), states the drive's sustained transfer speed as &quot;89 to 160 [[MiB]]/s&quot; on one line, and &quot;93 to 168 MB/s&quot; on the next line.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&quot;Advanced Format&quot; drives using 4096-byte sectors are described as having &quot;4K sectors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seagate marketing bulletin, [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/mb604_4k_transition_faq.pdf Advanced Format 4K Sector Transition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information transfer and clock rates===
Like the hard drive, there is nothing in a computer [[Clock signal|clock]] circuit or data transfer path that demands or even encourages that things happen at rates easily expressed using powers of 1024, or even using powers of 2.

Computer [[Clock signal|clock]] frequencies are always quoted using SI prefixes in their decimal sense. For example, the internal clock frequency of the original [[IBM PC]] was 4.77&amp;nbsp;MHz, that is, {{gaps|4|770|000}} Hz. &lt;!-- As a particularly &quot;odd&quot; example, some early microcomputer chips used the very widely available (and therefore inexpensive) [[NTSC]] [[colorburst]] crystal for their clock, resulting in a clock frequency of {{gaps|3|579|545|Hz}}. CN for this --&gt;

Similarly, digital information transfer rates are mostly quoted using decimal prefixes:
* The ATA-100 disk interface refers to {{gaps|100|000|000|bytes/s}}
* 1x CD-ROM CD-ROM speed is 150K or {{gaps|150|000|bytes/s}}
* A &quot;56K&quot; modem refers to {{gaps|56|000|bits/s}}
* SATA-2 has a raw bit rate of 3 Gbit/s = {{gaps|3|000|000|000|bits/s}}
* PC2-6400 ram transfers {{gaps|6|400|000|000|bytes/s}}
* Firewire 800 has a raw rate of {{gaps|800|000|000|bits/s}}
* As of 2011, Seagate specifies the transfer speed of some hard disk drives with IEC binary prefixes as well as decimal.&lt;ref name=savvio/&gt;

===Standardization of dual definitions===
By the mid 1970s it was common to see K meaning 1024 and the occasional M meaning {{gaps|1|048|576}} for words or bytes of main memory (RAM) while K and M were commonly used with their decimal meaning for disk storage.
In the 1980s, as capacities of both types of devices increased,
the SI prefix G, with SI meaning, was commonly applied to disk storage, while M in its binary meaning, became common for computer memory. In the 1990s, the prefix G, in its binary meaning, became commonly used for computer memory capacity. The first terabyte (SI prefix, {{gaps|1|000|000|000|000}} bytes) hard disk drive was introduced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dual usage of the kilo, mega, and giga prefixes and their corresponding symbols K, M, and G as both powers of 1000 and powers of 1024 was recorded in standards and dictionaries. For example, the 1986 ANSI/IEEE Std 1084-1986&lt;ref

The hardware industry has coped with the dual definitions because of relative consistency:
system memory (RAM) typically uses the binary meaning while magnetic disk storage uses the SI meaning.
There are, however, exceptions and special cases.
[[Diskette]]s use yet another &quot;megabyte&quot; equal to 1024Ã1000 bytes.&lt;ref
 name=&quot;Microsoft 121839&quot;/&gt;
In optical disks, [[Compact Disk]]s use MB to mean 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes while [[DVD]]s use GB to mean 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdromcap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcap&quot;/&gt;

==Inconsistent use of units==
===Deviation between powers of 1024 and powers of 1000===
Computer storage has become cheaper per unit and thereby larger, by many orders of magnitude since &quot;K&quot; was first used to mean 1024. 
Because both the SI and &quot;binary&quot; meanings of kilo, mega, etc., are based on [[Exponentiation|powers]] of 1000 or 1024 rather than simple multiples, the difference between 1M &quot;binary&quot; and 1M &quot;decimal&quot; is proportionally larger than that between 1K &quot;binary&quot; and 1k &quot;decimal,&quot; and so on up the scale.
The relative difference between the values in the binary and decimal interpretations increases, when using the SI prefixes as the base, from 2.4% for kilo to over 20% for the yotta prefix.

===Consumer confusion===
In the early days of computers there was little or no consumer confusion because of the sophisticated nature of the consumers and the practice of computer manufacturers to specify their products with capacities in full precision.
For example, in 1965 IBM stated about the System/360 Model 75 that &quot;Its main memory operated at 750 nanoseconds and was available in three sizes up to 1,048,576 characters of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP2075.html System/360 Model 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of consumer confusion is the difference in the way many operating systems display hard drive sizes, compared to the way hard drive manufacturers describe them.
As noted previously, hard drives are described and sold using &quot;GB&quot; or &quot;TB&quot; in their SI meaning: one billion and one trillion bytes.
Many operating systems and other software however display hard drive and file sizes using &quot;MB&quot;, &quot;GB&quot; or other SI-looking prefixes in their &quot;binary&quot; meaning, just as they do for displays of RAM capacity.
(The earliest known presentation of hard disk drive capacity by an operating system using &quot;KB&quot; or &quot;MB&quot; in a binary sense is 1984&lt;ref&gt;Apple [[Macintosh]] which began using &quot;KB&quot; in a binary sense to report HDD capacity beginning 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;; earlier operating systems generally presented hard disk drive capacity in decimal digits with no prefix of any sort, e.g. in the MS/PC DOS [[CHKDSK]] command.)

The following three images show the discrepancy of reporting the identical disk capacity on the manufacturer's packaging (160 GB = 160Ã1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the [[Windows XP]] disk manager (149.05 GB = 149.05Ã1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
and the drive properties display ({{gaps|152|625|MB}} = {{gaps|152|625}}Ã1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Seagate 160 GB hard drive box.jpg|Disk drive packaging specifies a disk capacity of 160Ã10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; bytes using standard [[SI prefix]]es.
Image:Windows XP Disk management for 160 GB disk.png|Windows XP disk management application lists the capacity of a 160Ã10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; byte disk drive as 149.05 GB
Image:Windows XP Drive Properties for 160 GB disk.png|Windows XP drive properties display lists the capacity of a 160Ã10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; byte disk drive as 152625 MB.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;!--- it would be nice to have a screen cap of Windows' drive properties display in which they list the capacity of this same drive as 160,xxx,yyy,zzz bytes.. spelled out to the last byte... as demo that Windows does
know how large the drive really is. However we need to either have a sample of exactly the same drive, or start over
and make four new images all of a new drive. ---&gt;

===Legal disputes===
The different interpretations of disk size prefixes has led to three significant class action lawsuits against digital storage manufacturers.
One case involved flash memory and the other two involved hard disk drives.
Both were settled with the manufacturers admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to clarify the storage capacity of their products on the consumer packaging.
Flash memory and hard disk manufacturers now have disclaimers on their packaging and web sites clarifying the formatted capacity of the devices&lt;ref name=&quot;sd-cap-disclaimer&quot;/&gt;
or defining MB as 1 million bytes and 1 GB as 1 billion bytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdc-CaviarSE16&quot;&gt;{{cite web

====Willem Vroegh v. Eastman Kodak Company====
On 20 February 2004, [[Willem Vroegh v.

Vroegh claimed that a 256 MB Flash Memory Device had only 244 MB of accessible memory. &quot;Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed the memory capacity of their products by assuming that one megabyte equals one million bytes and one gigabyte equals one billion bytes.&quot;
The plaintiffs wanted the defendants to use the traditional values of 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for megabyte and 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for gigabyte.
The plaintiffs acknowledged that the IEC and IEEE standards define a MB as one million bytes but stated that the industry has largely ignored the IEC standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vreogh-3rd&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Unique binary prefixes==
===Early suggestions===

While early computer scientists typically used k to mean 1000, some recognized the convenience that would result from working with multiples of 1024 and the confusion that resulted from using the same prefixes for two different meanings.

Several proposals for unique binary prefixes&lt;ref
group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.binpref&quot;&gt;A '''binary prefix''' is a prefix that denotes a power of 1024.
For example, in the computer industry's customary practice,
one &quot;megabyte&quot; of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes of RAM,
one &quot;gigabyte&quot; of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes of RAM, and so on.
In the IEC system, these would be expressed as one &quot;mebibyte&quot; and one &quot;gibibyte,&quot; respectively.
Both are &quot;binary prefixes&quot; in these usages.&lt;/ref&gt;
were made in 1968.
Donald Morrison proposed to use the Greek letter kappa ([[Îº]]) to denote 1024, Îº&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to denote 1024Ã1024, and so on.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Morrison&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal
|title=Letters to the editor: Abbreviations for computer and memory sizes

(At the time, memory size was small, and only K was in widespread use.)
[[Wallace Givens]] responded with a proposal to use bK as an abbreviation for 1024 and bK2 or bK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1024Ã1024, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter b would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Givens&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Bruce A. Martin]] further proposed that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter B be used as a binary exponent, similar to [[E notation]], to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3Ã2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref
name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

None of these gained much acceptance, and capitalization of the letter K became the ''de facto'' standard for indicating a factor of 1024 instead of 1000, although this could not be extended to higher powers.

As the discrepancy between the two systems increased in the higher order powers, more proposals for unique prefixes were made.
In 1996, [[Markus Kuhn]] proposed a system with ''di'' prefixes, like the &quot;dikilobyte&quot; (KâB or K2B).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhn&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===IEC prefixes===
The set of binary prefixes that were eventually adopted, now referred to as the &quot;IEC prefixes&quot;,&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.iecpref&quot;&gt; The term '''IEC binary prefix''' or '''IEC prefix''' refers to the prefixes such as kibi, mebi, gibi, etc., or their corresponding symbols Ki, Mi, Gi, etc., first adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC). Such prefixes are only used with the units bits or bytes (or compound units derived from them such as bytes/second) and always denote powers of 1024; that is, they are always used as binary prefixes. Thus 1 mebibyte of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes of RAM, 1 gibibyte or 1 GiB of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; were first proposed by the
[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]'s (IUPAC) Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) in 1995. At that time, it was proposed that the terms kilobyte and megabyte be used only for 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes and 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, respectively. The new prefixes ''kibi'' (kilobinary), ''mebi'' (megabinary) and ''gibi'' (gigabinary) were also proposed at the time, and the proposed symbols for the prefixes were kb, Mb and Gb respectively, rather than Ki, Mi and Gi.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucr-95&quot;&gt;http://ww1.iucr.org/cexec/rep95/idcns.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was not accepted at the time.

{{anchor|IEC standard prefixes}}

The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] (IEEE) began to collaborate with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) to find acceptable names for binary prefixes. The IEC proposed ''kibi'', ''mebi'', ''gibi'' and ''tebi'', with the symbols Ki, Mi, Gi and Ti respectively, in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucr-96&quot;&gt;[http://www.chester.iucr.org/iucr-top/cexec/rep96/idcns.htm 1996 IUCr IUPAC Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding reference is weak as it merely consists of IUPAC noting IEC's proposal, but it is apparently the only thing we have. Would be better to have a ref for the actual proposal --&gt;

The names for the new prefixes are derived from the original SI prefixes combined with the term ''binary'', but contracted, by taking the first two letters of the SI prefix and &quot;bi&quot; from binary. The first letter of each such prefix is therefore identical to the corresponding SI prefixes, except for &quot;K&quot;, which is used interchangeably with &quot;k&quot;, whereas in SI, only the lower-case k represents 1000.

The IEEE decided that their standards would use the prefixes ''kilo'', etc. with their metric definitions, but allowed the binary definitions to be used in an interim period as long as such usage was explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee-standards&quot;&gt;Bruce Barrow, &quot;A Lesson in Megabytes&quot;, ''IEEE Standards Bearer'', January 1997, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption by IEC and NIST===
In January 1999, the IEC published the first international standard (IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2) with the new prefixes, extended up to ''pebi'' (Pi) and ''exbi'' (Ei).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;These prefixes for binary multiples, which were developed by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 25, Quantities and units, and their letter symbols, with the strong support of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the IEEE, were adopted by the IEC as Amendment 2 to IEC International Standard IEC 60027-2: Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology â Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- the preceding reference really needs more than just a quote. From what is it quoting? ---&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iucr-99&quot;&gt;[http://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2000/06/00/es0288/es0288bdy.html#SEC15.1 IUCR 1999 report on IUPAC Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- this reference is weak as it merely consists of the International Union of Crystallography reporting on IUPAC's reporting on the IEC standard(!) ---&gt;

The IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2 also states that the IEC position is the same as that of BIPM (the body that regulates the SI system); the SI prefixes retain their definitions in powers of 1000 and are never used to mean a power of 1024.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In usage, products and concepts typically described using powers of 1024 would continue to be, but with the new IEC prefixes. For example, a memory module of {{gaps|536|870|912}} bytes (512Ã{{gaps|1|048|576}}) would be referred to as 512&amp;nbsp;MiB or 512&amp;nbsp;mebibytes instead of 512&amp;nbsp;MB or 512&amp;nbsp;megabytes. Conversely, since hard drives have historically been marketed using the SI convention that &quot;giga&quot; means {{gaps|1|000|000|000}}, a &quot;500&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; hard drive would still be labeled as such. According to these recommendations, operating systems and other software would also use binary and SI prefixes in the same way, so the purchaser of a &quot;500&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; hard drive would find the operating system reporting either &quot;500&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; or &quot;466&amp;nbsp;GiB&quot;, while {{gaps|536|870|912}} bytes of RAM would be displayed as &quot;512&amp;nbsp;MiB&quot;.

===Other standards bodies and organizations===
The IEC-proposed binary prefixes are now supported by other standardization bodies and technical organizations.

The United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) supports the ISO/IEC standards for
&quot;Prefixes for binary multiples&quot; and has a [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html web site] documenting them, describing and justifying their use. NIST suggests that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as ''bee''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST-biprefix&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In December 2002, [[JEDEC]], a leading standards organization in the microelectronics industry, mentioned the IEC prefixes in their ''Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microcomputers, Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits'' document. This document defines &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;mega&quot;, and &quot;giga&quot; with binary multipliers. A &quot;Note&quot; to this definition then states that that definition is only presented &quot;to reflect common usage&quot;, and quotes the IEC in describing the binary prefixes as &quot;an alternative system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-terms&quot;&gt;

The first goal affects the general public, the wide audience of technical and nontechnical persons who use computers without much concern for their construction or inner working. These persons will normally interpret kilo, mega, etc., in their proper decimal sense. The second goal speaks to specialists â the prefixes for binary multiples make it possible for persons who work in the information sciences to communicate with precision.

|chapter=Â§3.1 SI prefixes
|quote=[Side note:] These SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10. They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 (for example, one kilobit represents 1000 bits and not 1024 bits). The IEC has adopted prefixes for binary powers in the international standard IEC 60027-2: 2005, third edition, ''Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology â Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics''. The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt; are, respectively: kibi, Ki; mebi, Mi; gibi, Gi; tebi, Ti; pebi, Pi; and exbi, Ei. Thus, for example, one kibibyte would be written: 1 KiB = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; B = 1024 B, where B denotes a byte. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the incorrect usage of the SI prefixes.
|author=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society of Automobile Engineers|Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) prohibits the use of SI prefixes with anything but a power-of-1000 meaning, but does not recommend or otherwise cite the IEC binary prefixes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;&gt;
[http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/tsb/tsb003.pdf#page=33 Rules for SAE Use of SI (Metric) Units] â Section C.1.12 â SI prefixes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization ([[CENELEC]]) adopted the IEC-recommended binary prefixes via the harmonization document HD&amp;nbsp;60027-2:2003-03.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUHD&quot;&gt;[http://www.cenelec.eu/dyn/www/f?p=104:110:1546953662480229::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_LANG_ID:15306,25] Information about the harmonization document (obtainable on order, status: withdrawn)&lt;/ref&gt;
The European Union (EU) has required the use of the IEC binary prefixes since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenelec.eu/dyn/www/f?p=104:110:6177007965168887::::FSP_PROJECT,FSP_LANG_ID:20776,25] Information about the EN standardization process.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Even among proponents of unique prefixes for binary multiples, proposals for alternative sets of prefixes have continued following the introduction of Ki, Mi, etc., by the IEC. For example, [[Donald Knuth]], who uses decimal notation like 1 MB = 1000 kB,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knuth&quot;&gt;''[http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc1.ps.gz The Art of Computer Programming]'' Volume 1, [[Donald Knuth]], pp. 24 and 94&lt;/ref&gt; expressed &quot;astonishment&quot; that the IEC proposal was adopted, calling them &quot;funny-sounding&quot; and opining that proponents were assuming &quot;that standards are automatically adopted just because they are there.&quot; Knuth proposed that the powers of 1024 be designated as &quot;large kilobytes&quot; and &quot;large megabytes&quot; (abbreviated KKB and MMB, as &quot;doubling the letter connotes both binary-ness and large-ness&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Knuth-webpage&quot;&gt;[http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/news99.html Knuth: Recent News (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[SI prefix#Other and obsolete prefixes|Double prefixes]] were already abolished from SI, however, having a multiplicative meaning (&quot;MMB&quot; would be equivalent to &quot;TB&quot;), and this proposed usage never gained any traction.

==Current practice==
Most computer hardware uses [[SI prefixes]]&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt; to state capacity and define other performance parameters such as data rate. [[Main memory|Main]] and [[cache memory|cache]] memories are notable exceptions.

[[Main memory]] and [[cache memory]] universally use customary binary prefixes&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.cbp&quot;&gt;As used in this article, the term '''customary binary prefix''' or similar refers to prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, etc., borrowed from the similarly named [[SI prefix]]es but commonly used to denote a power of 1024.&lt;/ref&gt; to state capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/welcome.html Hewlett-Packard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dell.com/ Dell], [http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=16155&amp;SR=nav:shop:computers:desktops:ss&amp;ref=http%3A//www.sony.com/index.php Sony]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/mac/ Apple Inc.], [http://explore.toshiba.com/laptops Toshiba]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gateway.com/systems/category/529598023.php Gateway]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.sun.com/desktop/index.jsp Sun Microsystems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4allmemory.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.rdram_rambus_pc1066 4AllMemory.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, [[flash memory]], like that found in solid state drives, uses [[SI prefixes]]&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt; to state capacity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

With a few exceptions, most operating systems and other software continue to use the customary binary prefixes in displays of memory, disk storage capacity, and file size, but SI prefixes&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;&gt;The term '''SI prefix''' or similar refers to prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, etc., defined by the [[International System of Units|SI system]] of units and ''always'' used to denote a power of 1000; in other words, always as decimal prefixes.&lt;/ref&gt; in other areas such as network communication speeds and processor speeds.

Nearly all articles, papers, and marketing materials in the industry continue to use the customary binary prefixes when referring to computer memory, even those published under the aegis of organizations that have shown support for the IEC prefixes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the following subsections, unless otherwise noted, examples are first given using the common prefixes used in each case, and then followed by interpretation using other notation where appropriate.

===Operating Systems===
Prior to the release of [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh System Software]] (1984), file sizes were typically reported by the operating system without any prefixes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Today, most operating systems report file sizes with prefixes.

===Software===
{{As of|February 2010}}, most software does not distinguish symbols for binary and decimal prefixes.&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.decpref&quot;&gt;A '''decimal prefix''' is a prefix that denotes a [[Exponentiation|power]] of 1000. For example, &quot;kilo&quot; denotes 1000, &quot;mega&quot; denotes 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or one million, &quot;giga&quot; denotes 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or one billion, and so on. SI prefixes are decimal prefixes.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] binary naming convention has been adopted by a few, but this is not used universally.

One of the stated goals of the introduction of the IEC prefixes was &quot;to preserve the SI prefixes as unambiguous decimal multipliers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE1541&quot;/&gt; Programs such as [[fdisk]]/[[cfdisk]], [[parted]], and [[apt-get]] use SI prefixes with their decimal meaning.

&lt;gallery perrow=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

===Computer hardware===
{{As of|February 2010}}, ''no'' examples of hardware marketed using IEC binary prefixes have been found.
Even hardware types that use powers-of-1024 multipliers, such as memory, continue to be marketed with
customary binary prefixes.

====Computer memory====
[[Image:Memory module DDRAM 20-03-2006.jpg|thumb|The 536,870,912 byte (512Ã2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) capacity of these RAM modules is stated as &quot;512 MB&quot; on the label.]]

Measurements of most types of electronic '''[[computer memory|memory]]''' such as [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]] are given using customary binary prefixes (kilo, mega, and giga).  This includes some [[Flash memory]], like [[EEPROM]]s.
For example, a &quot;512 megabyte&quot; memory module is 512Ã2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes (512Ã{{gaps|1|048|576}}, or {{gaps|536|870|912}}).

JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, the semiconductor engineering standardization body of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), continues to include the customary binary definitions of kilo, mega and giga in their ''Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols'' document,&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-terms&quot;/&gt;
and uses those definitions in later memory standards&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-ddr3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-ddr2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-configs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-configs-toc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-configs-terms&quot;/&gt;
(See also [[JEDEC memory standards]].)

Many computer programming tasks reference memory in terms of [[powers of two]] because of the inherent binary design of current hardware addressing systems. For example, a 16-bit processor register can reference at most 65,536 items (bytes, words, or other objects); this is conveniently expressed as &quot;64K&quot; items.  An operating system might map memory as 4096-byte [[Page (computing)|pages]], in which case exactly 8192 pages could be allocated within {{gaps|33|554|432|bytes}} of memory: 8K (8192) pages of 4 kilobytes (4096) each within 32 megabytes (32 MiB) of memory.

====Hard disk drives====
All [[hard disk]] drive manufacturers state capacity using [[SI prefixes]].&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;i.e. see [http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/B259B4A73296DA628625751600058A80/$file/ProductBrochureMarch2009.pdf HGST], [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/faqView.do?b2b_bbs_msg_id=167 Samsung], [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/storage_solutions_guide.pdf Seagate], [http://sdd.toshiba.com/techdocs/MKxx33GSG_MK1235GSL_r1.pdf Toshiba] and [http://www.wdc.com/en/library/2579-001028.pdf Western Digital] websites&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flash drives====
[[USB flash drive]]s, flash-based memory cards like [[CompactFlash]] or [[Secure Digital]], and flash-based [[Solid-state drive|SSDs]] use [[SI prefixes]];&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt;
for example, a &quot;256 MB&quot; flash card provides at least 256 million bytes ({{gaps|256|000|000}}), not 256Ã1024Ã1024 ({{gaps|268|435|456}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;sd-cap-disclaimer&quot;&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/Categories/Products/sd_capacitydisclaimer.pdf
  | title = Secure Digital Capacity Disclaimer
  | format = PDF
  | work = sandisk.com
  | publisher = [[SanDisk|SanDisk Corporation]]
  | accessdate = 2007-09-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These devices usually physically contain the binary capacities, but some space is reserved for internal functions of the flash drive. In other words, there are physically 256Ã1024Ã1024  bytes of storage on a typical &quot;256MB&quot; flash drive, but some space is needed for functions like [[wear leveling]]. In the case of a &quot;256MB&quot; flash drive, the manufacturer can allocate approximately 12MB to internal functions, and still provide 256 million usable bytes.

====Floppy drives====
[[Floppy disk]]s have existed in numerous physical and logical [[List of floppy disk formats|formats]], and have been sized inconsistently.  In part, this is because the end user capacity of a particular disk is a function of the controller hardware, so that the same disk could be formatted to a variety of capacities.  In many cases, the media are marketed without any indication of the end user capacity, as for example, DSDD, meaning double-sided double-density.

The last widely adopted diskette was the 3Â½ inch high density. This has a formatted capacity of {{gaps|1|474|560}} bytes or 1440&amp;nbsp;KB (1440Ã1024, using &quot;KB&quot; in the customary binary sense). These are marketed as &quot;HD&quot;, or &quot;1.44&amp;nbsp;MB&quot; or both.
This case defines a &quot;third megabyte&quot; of 1000Ã1024.

Most operating systems display the capacity using &quot;MB&quot; in the customary binary sense, resulting in a display of &quot;1.4&amp;nbsp;MB&quot; (1.40625&amp;nbsp;MB). Some users have noticed the missing 0.04&amp;nbsp;MB and both Apple and Microsoft have support bulletins referring to them as 1.4 MB.&lt;ref
 name=&quot;Microsoft 121839&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | last =Microsoft
 | title = Determining Actual Disk Size: Why 1.44 MB Should Be 1.40 MB
 | work = Article ID: 121839
 | publisher =Microsoft

 | accessdate = 2007-07-07
}} &quot;The 1.44-megabyte (MB) value associated with the 3.5-inch disk format does not represent the actual size or free space of these disks. Although its size has been popularly called 1.44 MB, the correct size is actually 1.40 MB.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier 1200&amp;nbsp;KB (1200Ã1024) 5Â¼ inch diskette sold with the [[PC AT|IBM PC AT]] was marketed as 1.2&amp;nbsp;MB (1.171875&amp;nbsp;MiB).  The largest 8&amp;nbsp;inch diskette formats could contain more than a megabyte, and the capacities of those devices were often irregularly specified in megabytes, also without controversy.

Older and smaller diskette formats were usually identified as an accurate number of (binary) KB, for example the [[Disk II|Apple Disk II]] described as 140KB had a 140Ã1024 byte capacity, and the original &quot;360KB&quot; double sided, double density disk drive used on the IBM PC had a 360Ã1024 byte capacity.

In many cases diskette hardware was marketed based on unformatted capacity, and the overhead required to format sectors on the media would reduce the nominal capacity as well (and this overhead typically varied based on the size of the formatted sectors), leading to more irregularities.

====Optical discs====
The capacities of most [[optical disc]] storage media like [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[HD DVD]] and [[Magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical (MO)]]  are given using SI decimal prefixes.
A &quot;4.7 GB&quot; DVD has a nominal capacity of about 4.38 [[GiB]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcap&quot;&gt;[http://www.osta.org/technology/pdf/dvdqa.pdf#page=20 Understanding Recordable and Rewritable DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[compact disc|CD]] capacities are always given using customary binary prefixes. Thus a &quot;700 MB&quot; (or &quot;80 minute&quot;) CD has a nominal capacity of about 700 [[MiB]] (approx 730 MB).&lt;ref name=&quot;cdromcap&quot;&gt;[http://www.videohelp.com/forum/userguides/135642.php Data capacity of CDs]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tape drives and media====
Tape drive and media manufacturers use SI decimal prefixes to identify capacity.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/common/ssi/pm/sp/n/tsd00063usen/TSD00063USEN.PDFIBM 3592 Tape Cartridge], [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-319.pdf ECMA-319, Ultrium-1] etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data transmission and clock rates====
Certain units are always used with SI decimal prefixes even in computing contexts.
Two examples are [[hertz]] (Hz), which is used to measure the [[clock rate]]s of electronic components, and bit/s, used to measure [[bit rate|data transmission speed]].
* A 1&amp;nbsp;GHz processor receives {{gaps|1|000|000|000}} clock ticks per second
* A sound file sampled at 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz has {{gaps|44|100}} samples per second
* A 128 kbit/s [[MP3]] stream consumes {{gaps|128|000|bits}} (16 kilobytes, 15.6&amp;nbsp;KiB) per second
* A 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s Internet connection can transfer {{gaps|1|000|000|bits}} per second ({{gaps|125|000}} bytes per second â 122&amp;nbsp;KiB/s, assuming an 8-bit byte and no overhead)
* A 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet connection can transfer {{gaps|1|000|000|000|bits}} per second ({{gaps|125|000|000}} bytes per second â 119&amp;nbsp;MiB/s, assuming an 8-bit byte and no overhead)
* A [[56K]] modem transfers {{gaps|56|000}} bits per second â 6.8&amp;nbsp;KiB/s.

[[Computer bus|Bus]] clock speeds and therefore bandwidths are both quoted using SI decimal prefixes.

* [[DDR SDRAM|PC3200]] memory on a [[double data rate]] bus, transferring 8 bytes per cycle with a clock speed of 200&amp;nbsp;MHz ({{gaps|200|000|000|cycles}} per second) has a bandwidth of {{gaps|200|000|000|Ã|8|Ã|2}} = {{gaps|3|200|000|000|bytes/second}} = 3.2 GB/s (about 3.0&amp;nbsp;GiB/s).
* A [[PCI-X]] bus at 66&amp;nbsp;MHz ({{gaps|66|000|000|cycles}} per second), 64 bits per transfer, has a bandwidth of {{gaps|66|000|000|transfers/second|Ã|64|bits/transfer}} = {{gaps|4|224|000|000|bits/second}}, or {{gaps|528|000|000|bytes/second}}, usually quoted as 528 MB/s (about 503&amp;nbsp;MiB/s).
