}}The '''Open Build Service''' (formerly called '''OpenSUSE Build Service''' )&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/26/opensuse-renames-obs/ openSUSE renames OBS]&lt;/ref&gt; is an open and complete distribution development platform designed to encourage developers to compile packages for multiple [[Linux distribution|Linux distributions]] including  [[openSUSE]], [[Red Hat]], [[Mandriva]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]] and [[Debian]]. It typically simplifies the packaging process, so developers can more easily package a single program for many distributions, and many openSUSE releases, making more packages available to users regardless of what distribution they use. Also product and appliance building is supported by OBS.

The build service software is published under the [[GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-01/msg00002.html [opensuse-announce&amp;#93; Complete openSUSE Build Service under GPL available]&lt;/ref&gt; In an acknowledgement of its usefulness to the wider Linux community, the [[Linux Foundation]] has announced that the project will be added to the Linux Developer Network (LDN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/article/lf-make-opensuse-build-service-available-through-ldn LF to Make the openSUSE Build Service Available Through LDN]&lt;/ref&gt;. Also various companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_installations]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[MeeGo]] project are using it for developing their distribution.

It delivers also a full collaboration environment, allowing developer groups to build and submit changes to other projects.

__TOC__
== Workflow and usage ==
There are two ways to use Build Service: As a private installation and as an open service hosted on Novell's servers. When hosted at Novell, each packager is assigned a space (called home-project) where they can upload sources and definitions on how to build [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] or [[Deb (file format)|Debian packages]]. After each [[upload]], the openSUSE Build Service schedules the changed packages to rebuild. On completion, the resulting binary packages are published instantaneously to the download server, which makes them available to the public. 

The openSUSE Build Service provides a public [[Application programming interface|API]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://api.opensuse.org/apidocs openSUSE Build Service API Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; which is implemented in several [[User interface|user interfaces]]:
* a web interface at [https://build.opensuse.org build.opensuse.org]
* a [[command line interface]] called &lt;tt&gt;osc&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/CLI osc, the Python command line client]&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for integrating the openSUSE Build Service into [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] is developed as a [[Google Summer of Code]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/soc/2008/suse/appinfo.html?csaid=DFC9A170A95499CD Google Summer of Code: Project Application Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2008-suse/downloads/list Long_Hong sources tarball for BuildService &lt;-&gt; Eclipse Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://build.opensuse.org/package/files?package=BSUIPlugin&amp;project=home%3Alog111 prebuilt BSUIPlugin-1.2.0.jar Eclipse plugin at OBS]&lt;/ref&gt;
