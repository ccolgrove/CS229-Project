'''Siri''' ({{IPA-en|??s??ri|pron}}) is an [[intelligent software assistant]] and [[knowledge navigator]] functioning as a [[personal assistant]] application for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. The application uses a [[natural language user interface]] to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of [[web services]]. Siri claims that the software adapts to the user's individual preferences over time and personalizes results, as well as accomplishing tasks such as making dinner reservations and reserving a cab.<ref name="apple1">{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html |title=iPhone 4S - Ask Siri to help you get things done |publisher=Apple |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2011}}

Some Nexus S users have experienced an issue causing frequent random repeat firing of the capacitive buttons (especially the Search button) when using GSM 3G service. Affected users say the intermittent issue renders the device unusable, and have complained to Samsung, Google, and carriers like Rogers, Fido and AT&T. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/thread?hl=en&tid=49e8ca84071d51a4|title=Nexus S Voice Search Major Problem|work=Google Mobile Android Devices Support Forum|date=20 April 2011|accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>

The '''Nexus S''' is a [[smartphone]] co-developed by [[Google]] and [[Samsung]] and manufactured by [[Samsung Electronics]]. It was the first smartphone to use the [[Android (operating system)|Android 2.3 "Gingerbread"]] operating system, and the first Android device to support [[Near field communication|Near Field Communication]] (NFC) in both hardware and software.<ref name="engadget2">{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/15/the-nexus-s-a-closer-look/|title=The Nexus S: a closer look|last=Hollister|first=Sean|date=November 15, 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=16 November 2010}}

''Samsung''' has a long history of designing and producing [[System on Chip]]s (SoCs) and has been manufacturing SoCs for its own devices as well as others, for example Apple. The first Samsung SoC, S3C44B0, was built around an [[ARM7]] CPU which operated at 66&nbsp;MHz clock frequency. Later several SoCs, S3C2xxx, containing an [[ARM9]] CPU were produced.<ref>http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/productList.do?fmly_id=844&xFmly_id=229</ref>

In 2010 Samsung launched the S5PC110 also known as Hummingbird (now Exynos 3110) in its mobile phone [[Galaxy S]] which had a licensed [[ARM Cortex-A8]] CPU with a [[PowerVR]] SGX540 GPU.

In 2011 Samsung launched the [[Samsung_Exynos|Exynos]] 4210 SoC in its [[Galaxy S II]] mobile phone.

In fall 2011 Samsung introduced [[Samsung_Exynos|Exynos]] 4212 with higher clock frequency and  ???50 percent higher 3D graphics performance over the previous processor generation". Built with 32 nm High-K Metal Gate (HKMG) low-power process it promises ???30 percent lower power-level over the previous process generation.???

Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)].

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)].

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

Charlie White, at [[Mashable]], described the screen as "gorgeous", offering "an exquisitely sharp view", and describing the hardware design as "a spectacular success", concluding "The Samsung Galaxy Nexus is by far the best Android phone I???ve seen yet."<ref>[http://mashable.com/2011/11/17/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus Review]. Mashable.com (2011-11-17). Retrieved on 2011-11-21.</ref>

Joshua Topolsky from [[The Verge]] stated "It's one of the best smartphones ever made, and with a couple of minor tweaks (particularly to the camera), it could be the best smartphone ever produced."<ref>Newman, Jared. (2011-11-17) [http://www.pcworld.com/article/244225/galaxy_nexus_reviews_of_course_its_the_best_android.html Galaxy Nexus Reviews: Of Course It's the Best Android]. PCWorld. Retrieved on 2011-11-21. </ref>

Vincent Nguyen, from [[SlashGear]] noted the fast performance of Android 4.0.1, the tight integration between the operating system and the hardware and concluded that "this is the best Android phone around today".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-nexus-review-21196912/ |title=Galaxy Nexus Review |publisher=SlashGear |date=2006-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display. It's screamingly fast, too, delivering what may be the best overall performance of any mobile device available."

Be careful with the reviews or similar material you add. They should only be sourced to reliable/trusted organizations and should be presented in a neutral way. "Original research" is not allowed, meaning you can't describe your own experiences (positive or negative) nor advance conclusions beyond what is in the sources.
Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.
It is also a good idea to discuss the changes on the talk page if you are unsure if they are appropriate to the article

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)].

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

Charlie White, at [[Mashable]], described the screen as "gorgeous", offering "an exquisitely sharp view", and describing the hardware design as "a spectacular success", concluding "The Samsung Galaxy Nexus is by far the best Android phone I???ve seen yet."<ref>[http://mashable.com/2011/11/17/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus Review].

Joshua Topolsky from [[The Verge]] stated "It's one of the best smartphones ever made, and with a couple of minor tweaks (particularly to the camera), it could be the best smartphone ever produced."<ref>Newman, Jared.

Retrieved on 2011-11-21. </ref>

Vincent Nguyen, from [[SlashGear]] noted the fast performance of Android 4.0.1, the tight integration between the operating system and the hardware and concluded that "this is the best Android phone around today".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-nexus-review-21196912/ |title=Galaxy Nexus Review |publisher=SlashGear |date=2006-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display. It's screamingly fast, too, delivering what may be the best overall performance of any mobile device available."

Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)]. Engadget. Retrieved on 2011-11-21.</ref>
In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid.

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)].

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

Charlie White, at [[Mashable]], described the screen as "gorgeous", offering "an exquisitely sharp view", and describing the hardware design as "a spectacular success", concluding "The Samsung Galaxy Nexus is by far the best Android phone I???ve seen yet."<ref>[http://mashable.com/2011/11/17/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus Review]. Mashable.com (2011-11-17). Retrieved on 2011-11-21.</ref>

Joshua Topolsky from [[The Verge]] stated "It's one of the best smartphones ever made, and with a couple of minor tweaks (particularly to the camera), it could be the best smartphone ever produced."<ref>Newman, Jared. (2011-11-17) [http://www.pcworld.com/article/244225/galaxy_nexus_reviews_of_course_its_the_best_android.html Galaxy Nexus Reviews: Of Course It's the Best Android]. PCWorld. Retrieved on 2011-11-21. </ref>

Vincent Nguyen, from [[SlashGear]] noted the fast performance of Android 4.0.1, the tight integration between the operating system and the hardware and concluded that "this is the best Android phone around today".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-nexus-review-21196912/ |title=Galaxy Nexus Review |publisher=SlashGear |date=2006-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}</ref>

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display. It's screamingly fast, too, delivering what may be the best overall performance of any mobile device available."

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid.

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back.

Be careful with the reviews or similar material you add. They should only be sourced to reliable/trusted organizations and should be presented in a neutral way. "Original research" is not allowed, meaning you can't describe your own experiences (positive or negative) nor advance conclusions beyond what is in the sources.
Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.
It is also a good idea to discuss the changes on the talk page if you are unsure if they are appropriate to the article

Be careful with the reviews or similar material you add. They should only be sourced to reliable/trusted organizations and should be presented in a neutral way. "Original research" is not allowed, meaning you can't describe your own experiences (positive or negative) nor advance conclusions beyond what is in the sources.
Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.
It is also a good idea to discuss the changes on the talk page if you are unsure if they are appropriate to the article

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better.

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display.

Be careful with the reviews or similar material you add. They should only be sourced to reliable/trusted organizations and should be presented in a neutral way. "Original research" is not allowed, meaning you can't describe your own experiences (positive or negative) nor advance conclusions beyond what is in the sources.
Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.
It is also a good idea to discuss the changes on the talk page if you are unsure if they are appropriate to the article

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)].

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

Be careful with the reviews or similar material you add. They should only be sourced to reliable/trusted organizations and should be presented in a neutral way. "Original research" is not allowed, meaning you can't describe your own experiences (positive or negative) nor advance conclusions beyond what is in the sources.
Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.
It is also a good idea to discuss the changes on the talk page if you are unsure if they are appropriate to the article

According to [[Engadget]] editor Darren Murph, the Galaxy Nexus was "smooth as ever. Without question, this is easily the slickest, most polished version of Android yet"<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/19/google-ice-cream-sandwich-android-4-0-a-hands-on-screenshot-g/ Google Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0): a hands-on screenshot gallery].

In a way, it's as if Android's growing a bit and maturing before our eyes", concluding with "Overall, we're thrilled with how the first [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|ICS]] handset has turned out. It's understated, sleek, beautiful and packs a display that's destined to drop jaws."<ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/samsung-galaxy-nexus-hands-on/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich hands-on (video)]. Engadget. Retrieved on 2011-11-21.</ref>
In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

The GSMArena review concludes stating "The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_hands_on-review-663p4.php |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus hands-on: First look |publisher=GSMArena.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

Charlie White, at [[Mashable]], described the screen as "gorgeous", offering "an exquisitely sharp view", and describing the hardware design as "a spectacular success", concluding "The Samsung Galaxy Nexus is by far the best Android phone I???ve seen yet."<ref>[http://mashable.com/2011/11/17/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review/ Samsung Galaxy Nexus Review].

Joshua Topolsky from [[The Verge]] stated "It's one of the best smartphones ever made, and with a couple of minor tweaks (particularly to the camera), it could be the best smartphone ever produced."<ref>Newman, Jared.

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display. It's screamingly fast, too, delivering what may be the best overall performance of any mobile device available."

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

Joshua Topolsky from [[The Verge]] stated "It's one of the best smartphones ever made, and with a couple of minor tweaks (particularly to the camera), it could be the best smartphone ever produced."<ref>Newman, Jared.

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display. It's screamingly fast, too, delivering what may be the best overall performance of any mobile device available."

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life. However, she did note that the camera was "underwhelming" and that the build quality was average.<ref>http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/24/galaxy-nexus-hspa-review/</ref>

In a [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] review Thomas Tamblyn noted the camera was "quicker than many digital cameras" and concluded saying "the whole experience is very fluid. Even in its current form [a pre-release version] It feels like a version of Android that is already very polished."<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 18:31 26 Oct 2011 by Thomas Tamblyn |url=http://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-nexus-review |title=Samsung Galaxy Nexus review: Hands on |publisher=T3 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

Mobilesyrup's review indicates "From our time with the device, we can safely say there is no going back. Every piece of Android hardware from this day on will be judged not on the speed of its processor or its pixel density but on whether it is running Ice Cream Sandwich. The Galaxy Nexus has a market lead so vast as to be a chasm; the experience is just that much better. [...] Samsung has wisely taken the best design aspects of the Nexus S and Galaxy S II variants and created the first best Android device ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/11/17/galaxy-nexus-review-part-1-hardware-overview-video/|title=Galaxy Nexus Review Part 1: Hardware Overview (video)|publisher=mobilesyrup.com|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref>

JR Raphael, from [[Computerworld]], stated "The Galaxy Nexus [...] is an exceptional phone, arguably the finest Android handset to date.", concluding "The Galaxy Nexus is sleek and attractive, with a thin, light body and a beautiful HD display.

Be careful with the reviews or similar material you add. They should only be sourced to reliable/trusted organizations and should be presented in a neutral way. "Original research" is not allowed, meaning you can't describe your own experiences (positive or negative) nor advance conclusions beyond what is in the sources.
Both negative and positive reviews can be included, assuming they comply with Wikipedia policies/guidelines (and common sense) and are not given undue weight.
Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.
It is also a good idea to discuss the changes on the talk page if you are unsure if they are appropriate to the article

In their official review of the Galaxy Nexus (HSPA+ variant) Engadget editor Myriam Joire concluded that "The Galaxy Nexus is definitely the best Android phone available today -- it's possibly even the best phone available today, period", praising it for its speed, feel, display and battery life.

Take care to avoid listing all the points of the reviews. Instead, try to make a very abbreviated version, focusing mainly on the reviewer conclusion.

In 2010 Samsung launched the S5PC110 also known as Hummingbird (now Exynos 3110) in its mobile phone [[Galaxy S]] which had a licensed [[ARM Cortex-A8]] CPU with a [[PowerVR]] SGX540 GPU.

In 2011 Samsung launched the [[Samsung_Exynos|Exynos]] 4210 SoC in its [[Galaxy S II]] mobile phone.

In fall 2011 Samsung introduced [[Samsung_Exynos|Exynos]] 4212 with higher clock frequency and  ???50 percent higher 3D graphics performance over the previous processor generation". Built with 32 nm High-K Metal Gate (HKMG) low-power process it promises ???30 percent lower power-level over the previous process generation.???
