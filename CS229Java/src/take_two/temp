Following the Body Bag Game game the Eagles would go on to win five of their last seven under Cunningham, finish the season 10-6 and earn a wild card playoff berth, the fourth seed in the tough NFC.  The Redskins meanwhile also would win five of their last seven to finish the season 10-6, losing the number four seed spot to the Eagles.  Despite this, the Redskins would return to Veterans Stadium and defeat the Eagles in the [[1990â91 NFL playoffs#NFC: Washington Redskins 20, Philadelphia Eagles 6|Wild Card playoff game]], 20-6.  The Redskins would go on to lose to defending Super Bowl champion [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]] in the divisional round.  However, as told in the NFL Network presentation ''America's Game: The Story of the 1991 Washington Redskins'', coach [[Joe Gibbs]] and others pointed to this game as the foundation for the successes of the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|1991 Redskins]], who would go on to win [[Super Bowl XXVI]].

During the 2010 offseason, the Cavaliers fired head coach [[Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)|Mike Brown]], along with most of their coaching staff. General Manager [[Danny Ferry]] resigned on June 4, 2010 and Assistant General Manager Chris Grant was promoted to replace Ferry. On July 1, the Cavaliers hired former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] guard and former [[New Jersey Nets]] and [[New Orleans Hornets]] head coach [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] as the 18th head coach in franchise history.  

The Cavaliers spent the rest of the 2010 off-season rebuilding their team after James' departure. On July 23, they signed 2009 first-round pick [[Christian Eyenga]]. On July 26, the Cavs traded [[Delonte West]] and [[Sebastian Telfair]] to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for [[Ramon Sessions]], [[Ryan Hollins]] and a 2013 second round draft pick. On July 30, the Cavaliers signed free agent [[Joey Graham]] to a one-year, veteran's minimum contract with a team option for a second year. On August 16, the Cavs signed undrafted Jamaican rookie [[Samardo Samuels]] to a three-year, $2.3 million contract. On September 20, [[Jawad Williams]] and the Cavs decided to resign and reached a one-year $1.02 million contract. After finishing the [[2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2010 pre-season]] with a 6â2 record, the Cavs decided to waive [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]]<ref>http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/roster_moves_101019.html</ref> and sign with the undrafted rookie [[Manny Harris]], the Cavs also decided to exercise the fourth-year option with [[J.J.

Clippers]], which wound being the number one pick in the entire draft, for [[Mo Williams]] and [[Jamario Moon]] in return.<ref>http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/davis_110224.html</ref> The Cavaliers also sent a 2013 second-round pick to the [[Boston Celtics]] for [[Luke Harangody]] and [[Semih Erden]]. [[Leon Powe]] was waived to create roster space.<ref>http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/trade_110224.html</ref> 

On the court, the 2010â11 season was a stark contrast from the previous two seasons.  The Cavaliers were conference-worst 19â63.  This season also saw the Cavs lose 26 games in a row, which set an NBA record and tied the 1976â77 [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] for the longest losing streak in any American professional team sport. The Cavaliers had upset wins against the Los Angeles Lakers (57-25), Miami Heat (58-24) and Boston Celtics (56-26) during the season.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2011/02/sloppy_from_start_to_finish_cl.html]</ref>

Having the second-worst team record in the 2010â11 season, the Cavaliers had high odds of winning an early draft pick in the [[NBA Draft Lottery]].  With owner Dan Gilbert's 14 year-old son Nick representing the team at the dias (quipping "What's not to like?" when ESPN reporter [[Heather Cox]] asked him what he thought of his father calling him "his hero" due to overcoming health problems), the pick received from the Clippers in the Mo Williams/Baron Davis trade was what became the top overall pick, even though there was only a 2.8% chance of it happening.  The Cavaliers original first round selection ended up as the #4 selection in the draft.  The Cavs became the first team since the [[1983-84 Houston Rockets season|1983 Houston Rockets]] to have two picks in the top five in the draft. The Cavaliers took Duke guard [[Kyrie Irving]] with the first pick, even though he only played 11 games in college. With the 4th pick, the Cavaliers selected Texas power forward [[Tristan Thompson]].

On June 30, 2011, the team traded for small forward [[Omri Casspi]] and a 2012 first-round draft pick, sending the [[Sacramento Kings]] forward/center [[J.J. Hickson]].  The ''[[The News-Herald (Ohio)|News-Herald]]'' opined that Casspi will likely start at small forward for the Cavaliers.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bob Finnan |url=http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/06/30/sports/doc4e0cbcf41bf57924185256.txt |title=Cavaliers trade J.J.

[[Image:LebronFT.jpg|thumb|James was selected 1st overall in 2003.]]
Several losing seasons followed which saw the Cavaliers drop to the bottom of the league and become a perennial lottery draft team. After another disappointing season in [[2002â03 NBA season|2002â03]], the Cavaliers landed the number one draft pick in the [[NBA Lottery]]. With it, the team selected local high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP [[LeBron James]]. As if celebrating a new era in Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, the team's colors were changed from orange, black and blue back to wine and gold, with the addition of navy blue and a new primary logo.

James' status as both an area star (having played his high school basketball at [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School (Akron, Ohio)|St. Vincent-St. Mary High School]] in nearby [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]) and as one of the most highly touted prospects in NBA history has led many to view his selection as a turning point in the franchise's history. Embraced by Clevelanders as "King James,"  the [[2003â04 NBA season|2003â04]] season offered great hope for the future, as James rose to become a dominating player, winning the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]].  Hope was even greater for the [[2004â05 NBA season|2004â05]] season. James increased his production in terms of points, rebounds, and assists per game.  Despite [[Carlos Boozer free agency controversy|the loss of Carlos Boozer]] in the offseason, James teamed with [[Å½ydrÅ«nas Ilgauskas]] and [[Drew Gooden]] to form the core of the team.  After a promising start, the [[2004â05 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavs]] began a downward spiral that eventually led to the firing of coach [[Paul Silas]] and general manager [[Jim Paxson]].  The team failed to make the [[2005 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] that year, tied with [[New Jersey Nets]] for the final playoff spot with identical 42â40 records; however, the Nets owned the tiebreaker due to having the better head to head record vs the Cavs.

The [[2005â06 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavaliers]] made many changes in the 2005 offseason.  Under new owner [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]], the team hired a new head coach, [[Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)|Mike Brown]], and a new general manager, former Cavaliers forward [[Danny Ferry]].  The team experienced success on the court in the [[2005â06 NBA season|following season]], clinching their first playoff appearance since [[1997â98 NBA season|1998]].  After a first round win over the [[2006â07 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]], the Cavaliers rebounded from a 0â2 deficit in the second round against the [[Detroit Pistons]], winning three consecutive games to come one game away from the conference finals. They lost a close Game 6 at home, and followed it with a 79â61 loss in Game 7.  The playoff rounds were a showcase for the emergence of LeBron James, who achieved many "youngest ever to..." records during the run.

The Cavs continued their success in the [[2006â07 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2006â07]] season. The team earned the second seed in the East with a 50â32 record, generating a series of favorable matchups in the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].  They battled 7th-seeded Wizards, who struggled with injuries near the end of the season.  The Cavaliers swept this series 4â0 , and defeated the [[New Jersey Nets]], 4â2, in the second round.

The Cavaliers faced the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.  After again losing the first two games at Detroit, the Cavaliers won the next three to take a 3â2 series lead.  This time, the Cavaliers eliminated Detroit in Game 6.  The wins included a 109â107 double-overtime game at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] in Game 5, in which LeBron James scored the last 25 points for the Cavs, and his performance in this game is recognized as one of the best in NBA history.  They continued to a dominant 98â82 win at home in Game 6.  Rookie [[Daniel Gibson|Daniel "Boobie" Gibson]] scored a career-high 31 points in the series clincher, and the franchise won its first ever Eastern Conference Championship.  

The team's first trip to the [[2007 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] was a short one, as they were outmatched and outplayed by the very strong [[San Antonio Spurs]], who swept the Cavs 4â0. <!-- [[Image:CavsGuitar.jpg|thumb|Cleveland Cavaliers guitar in front of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].]] -->

The [[2007â08 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavs]] took a step back in the [[2007â08 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2007â08 season]].  They battled injuries and had many roster changes, including a three team trade at the trade deadline in which the team acquired F [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], G-F [[Wally Szczerbiak]], F-C [[Ben Wallace]], and G [[Delonte West]].  The Cavs finished 45â37 and lost in the second round against eventual champion Boston of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].  

In the 2008 off-season, the  team made a major change to its lineup, trading G Damon Jones and Smith (who later in the season rejoined  the Cavs after being released by [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Oklahoma City]]) for point guard [[Mo Williams]]. This trade was made in hopes of bringing another scorer to aid James.  

In the [[2008-09 Cleveland Cavaliers season|next season]], the Cavs made astounding progress. They finished with a record of 66â16, the winningest season in the franchise's history. The year marked other notable franchise records, including a 13-game winning streak, and road and home winning records. The Cavs entered the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] as the #1 seed in the NBA with home court advantage throughout the playoffs.  They finished the season 39â2 at home, one win short of the [[1985-86 Boston Celtics season|best all-time home record]]. Head Coach Mike Brown won [[NBA Coach of the Year]] honors and [[LeBron James]] finished second in the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] and won the [[NBA MVP]]. The Cavs began the 2009 postseason by sweeping the 8th-seeded [[2008â09 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] 4â0, winning every game by 10 or more points. In the conference semifinals, the Cavaliers faced the 4th-seeded [[2008â09 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]], who had defeated the [[2008â09 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] in seven games. Despite the Cavaliers' long layoff between the series they swept the Hawks 4â0, again winning each game by at least ten points, becoming the first team in NBA history to win eight straight playoff games by a double-digit margin.  

The Cavs then met the [[2008â09 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] in the Eastern Conference Finals.  The Cavs lost Game 1 of the series 107â106 at home despite James' 49-point effort.  Despite winning Game 2 by a score of 96â95, with the help of a James buzzer beating three-pointer, it was not enough as Orlando eventually took the series in 6 games. 

On June 25, 2009, 4-time NBA Champion and 15-time All-Star center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] was traded from the [[Phoenix Suns]] to the Cavaliers. The trade sent [[Ben Wallace]] and [[Sasha Pavlovic]] to Phoenix along with the 46th pick in the [[2010 NBA Draft]] and $500,000 in cash considerations.<ref>"ESPN", http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4285489, Retrieved June 24, 2009.</ref>

During the 2009 offseason, the Cavaliers signed wingman [[Anthony Parker]], and forwards [[Leon Powe]] and [[Jamario Moon]] for [[2009-10 Cleveland Cavaliers season|the following season]].  On February 17, 2010, the Cavaliers acquired All-Star forward [[Antawn Jamison]] from the [[Washington Wizards]] and [[Sebastian Telfair]] from the [[LA Clippers]] in a three way trade.  The Cavaliers originally lost [[Å½ydrÅ«nas Ilgauskas]] (center) in this trade, but after being waived by Washington, he signed back with the Cavaliers on March 23, 2010 for the rest of the 2009â2010 season.  The Cavaliers managed to finish with the NBA's best record for the second straight season, with a 61â21 record.  LeBron James was named the [[NBA MVP]], for the second consecutive year.  The Cavaliers defeated the [[Chicago Bulls]] 4â1 in the first round of the [[2010 NBA Playoffs]] but, in a huge upset, lost to the [[Boston Celtics]] after leading the series 2â1, with the Celtics proceeding to win 3 consecutive games (afterwards, the Celtics went to the [[2010 NBA Finals]] and lost to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 4â3.) Each team would suffer record-setting playoff defeats on home soil; the Celtics lost by 29, 124â95, in Game 3 (May 7), the greatest defeat in the history of the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, while the Cavaliers lost by 32, 120â88, in Game 5 (May 11).


With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus then turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a one hour show named ''The Decision'' on [[ESPN]] that he would be signing with the [[Miami Heat]]. The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. A couple of LeBron James jerseys were burned, and the famous Nike "Witness" mural of James in downtown Cleveland was immediately taken down. Shortly after James made his announcement, Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, announced in an open letter on the Cavaliers website that James' decision was a "cowardly betrayal" and promised a NBA championship for the Cleveland Cavaliers before LeBron James wins one. Despite being ridiculed for the letter by the media, Cleveland fans embraced the owner, even offering to pay the $100,000 fine given by the NBA.

The father of [[Brett Tomko]], Jerry Tomko, submitted the winning entry to name the team the "Cavaliers" through a competition sponsored by the [[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|Cleveland Plain Dealer]], supporters preferred it to "Jays", "Foresters" and "Presidents".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2009/05/cc_sabathia_lebron_james_and_t.html |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-28 |title=CC Sabathia, LeBron James and the naming of the Cleveland Cavaliers |publisher=The Star-Ledger}}</ref> Playing their home games at [[Cleveland Arena]] under the direction of head coach [[Bill Fitch]], they compiled a league-worst 15&ndash;67 record. The team hoped to build around the number one 1971 draft pick [[Austin Carr]] who had set numerous scoring records at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]], but Carr severely injured his leg shortly into his pro career and never was able to realize his potential.The following seasons saw the Cavaliers gradually improve their on-court performance, thanks to season-by-season additions of talented players such as [[Bingo Smith]], [[Jim Chones]], [[Jim Cleamons]] and [[Dick Snyder]]. Cleveland improved to 23–59 in their [[1971–72 NBA season|sophomore season]], followed by a 32&ndash;50 record in 1972&ndash;73, and a small step backwards to 29&ndash;53 in 1973&ndash;74. In 1974, the Cavaliers moved into the brand-new [[Richfield Coliseum]], located in a rural area thirty miles south of downtown Cleveland in [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]] (now part of the [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]]). That [[1974–75 NBA season|season]], the Cavaliers finished with a 40&ndash;42 record, falling just short of a playoff berth.In the [[1975–76 NBA season|1975&ndash;76]] season with Carr, Smith, Chones, Snyder, and newly acquired [[Nate Thurmond]]; Fitch led the Cavaliers to a 49&ndash;33 record and a division title. Fitch received the league's [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year]] award as the Cavs made their first-ever playoff appearance, and clinched their first [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] Title.The Cavs won the series against the [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets]], 4–3. Because of the many heroics and last-second shots, the series became known locally as the "Miracle of Richfield." Hampered by injuries, particularly to Jim Chones, the Cavs proceeded to lose to the [[1975–76 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in Eastern Conference Finals of the [[1976 NBA Playoffs|NBA playoffs]].Cleveland won 43 games the next two seasons (1976&ndash;77 and 1977&ndash;78), but both those seasons resulted in early playoff exits. After a 30–52 season in [[1978–79 NBA season|1978&ndash;79]], Fitch resigned as head coach.===1980&ndash;1983: Under Ownership of Ted Stepien===The [[1979–80 NBA season|following season]], after going 37–45 under Fitch's successor [[Stan Albeck]], original owner Mileti sold his shares to minority owner Joe Zingale. In 1980, after just a few months, Zingale sold the team to Nationwide Advertising magnate [[Ted Stepien]]. The new owner oversaw the hiring and firing of a succession of coaches and was involved in making a number of poor trade and free agent signing decisions. The result of Stepien's questionable trading acumen was the loss of several of the team's first-round draft picks, which led to a rule change in the NBA prohibiting teams from trading away first-round draft picks in consecutive years. This rule is known as the "Ted Stepien Rule."Early on in his tenure, Stepien proposed to rename the team the "Ohio Cavaliers", part of a plan that included playing their home games not just in the Cleveland area but in [[Cincinnati]] and in non-Ohio markets such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. He introduced a [[polka]]-flavored fight song, which was widely-ridiculed by fans and the media. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}The ensuing chaos had a major effect on both the Cavaliers' on-court performance and lack of local support, going 28&ndash;54 in [[1980-81 NBA season|1980&ndash;81]] (Stepien's first year as owner), followed by an abysmal 15&ndash;67 mark in [[1981-82 NBA season|1981&ndash;82]]. The 1981&ndash;82 team lost its last 19 games of the season which, when coupled with the five losses at the start of the [[1982-83 NBA season|1982&ndash;83 season]], constitute the [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|NBA's second all-time longest losing streak at 24 games]]. Although the team improved its record to 23&ndash;59 the following year, local support for the Cavs eroded which eventually bottomed out that year by averaging only 3,900 fans a game at the cavernous [[Richfield Coliseum|Coliseum]] which seated more than 20,000. Though Stepien eventually threatened to move the franchise to [[Toronto]] and rename it the Toronto Towers, but brothers George and [[Gordon Gund]] purchased the franchise in the mid 1980s and decided to keep the team in Cleveland (a decade later, Toronto would eventually receive an expansion franchise, the [[Toronto Raptors]].)===1983&ndash;1993: New Look and New Success===Shortly after purchasing the Cavaliers in 1983, the Gunds changed the team colors from wine and gold to burnt orange and navy blue. Furthermore, they officially adopted "Cavs" as a shorter nickname for marketing purposes, as it had been used unofficially by fans and headline writers since the team's inception.Under the coaching of [[George Karl]], the Cavaliers failed again, and missed the playoffs, with a 28-54 record, in the [[1983-84 NBA season|1983-84]]. The Cavs finally returned to the playoffs in [[1984-85 NBA season|1985]], only to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference Champions [[1984-85 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in the first round. At this point, the team was in transition, led by dynamic players such as [[World B. Free]], [[Roy Hinson]] and [[John Bagley (basketball)|John Bagley]]. But in 1986, Karl was fired after 66 games. Interim head coach [[Gene Littles]] guided the team the rest of the way, which saw the Cavs finish just one game short of the playoffs. After the season, it was time for a major overhaul. During the 7 season period the Cavaliers had 9 head coaches; [[Stan Albeck]], [[Bill Musselman]], [[Don Delaney]], [[Bob Kloppenburg]], [[Chuck Daly]], [[Bill Musselman]] (again), [[Tom Nissalke]], [[George Karl]], and [[Gene Littles]]. The only playoff appearance earned during this stretch was during the 1984-85 season under [[George Karl]] losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round in four games (3-1).In 1986, the Cavaliers acquired, either through trades or the [[1986 NBA Draft|draft]], [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]], [[Mark Price]], [[Ron Harper]] and [[Larry Nance]]. These four players (until Harper was later traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in 1989 for the rights to [[Danny Ferry]]) formed the core of the team, under the direction of head coach [[Lenny Wilkens]], that led the Cavs to eight playoff seasons in the next nine years, including three 50+ win seasons.In 1989, the [[1988-89 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavs]] were paired against the Michael Jordan-led [[1988-89 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] in the first round of the [[1989 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. In the fourth game of the best-of-five-series, Cleveland managed to beat the Bulls in overtime 108&ndash;105 to level the series at 2&ndash;2. Home court advantage went to Cleveland. The game was evenly matched, until Cleveland managed to score on a drive and raise the lead by one, with three seconds left. Chicago called for a time-out. The ball was inbounded to [[Michael Jordan]], who went for a jump shot. Cleveland's [[Craig Ehlo]] jumped in front to block it, but Jordan seemed to stay in the air until Ehlo landed. "[[The Shot]]" went in as time ran out, with Chicago winning the series 3&ndash;2. The buzzer-beater is considered one of Jordan's greatest clutch moments, and the game itself one of the greatest. But the pinnacle of the [[1991-92 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavs']] success came in the [[1991–92 NBA season|1991&ndash;92]] season, when they compiled a 57&ndash;25 record and advanced to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]], losing again to the [[1991-92 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] 4&ndash;2.===1993&ndash;2003: A Decade of Struggle===Soon after, the Cavaliers entered into a period of decline. With the retirements and departures of Nance, Daugherty, and Price, the team lost much of its dominance and were no longer able to contest strongly during the playoffs.  After the [[1992–93 NBA season|1992&ndash;93]] season, in which the Cavs boasted a 54–28 regular-season record but suffered an early exit from the playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals to the Chicago Bulls, Wilkens left to coach the [[Atlanta Hawks]].Following the hiring of [[Mike Fratello]] as head coach starting with the [[1993–94 NBA season|1993–94 season]], the Cavs became one of the NBA's best defensive teams under the leadership of point guard [[Terrell Brandon]]. But the offense, which was a half-court, "slow-down" tempo installed by Fratello, met with mixed success. Although the Cavaliers made regular playoff appearances, they were unable to advance beyond the first round.In 1994, the Cavs moved back to downtown Cleveland with the opening of the 20,562-seat, state-of-the-art, [[Quicken Loans Arena|Gund Arena]]. Known by locals as "the Gund", the venue served as the site of the [[1997 NBA All-Star Game]]. The arena and the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Progressive Field|Jacobs Field]] were built together as part of the city's Gateway project.Later on, players like [[Shawn Kemp]] and [[Žydrūnas Ilgauskas]] added quality to the team, but without further success. Fratello was fired following the shortened [[1998–99 NBA season|1998–99]] season.Despite the arrivals of [[Andre Miller]], [[Brevin Knight]], [[Chris Mihm]] and [[Carlos Boozer]], the Cavs were a perennial lottery team for the early part of the 2000s. The 2002-03 team finished with the third-worst record in franchise history (17-65), which earned them a tie for last place in the league and a 22.5 percent chance at winning the NBA Draft Lottery and the first overall selection. [[Ricky Davis]] received national attention on March 16, 2003 in game against the [[Utah Jazz]]. With Cleveland ahead in the game 120–95, Davis was one rebound short of a [[triple-double]] with only a few seconds left on the clock. After receiving an inbound pass at the Cavs' end of the floor, Davis banged the ball off the rim and caught it in attempt to receive credit for a rebound. Utah's [[DeShawn Stevenson]] took offense to this breach of [[sportsmanship|sportman's etiquette]] and immediately fouled Davis hard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/cavaliers/2003-03-17-davis-jazz_x.htm |last=Dixon |first=Oscar |date=March 17, 2003 |title=Jazz take offense when Cavaliers' Davis tries to pad stats |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=2008-12-26.}}</ref> The play did not count as a rebound since firing at your own team's basket does not count as a shot attempt, and in fact is a technical foul under NBA rules. Since the referees had never seen anyone shoot at their own basket before, they were unfamiliar with the rule and play was allowed to continue. This (which led to Davis being nicknamed in Cleveland as "Wrong Rim Ricky") and countless other selfish acts contributed to the Cavs trading of Davis later that year and ushering in a new type of team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1686963 |date=December 16, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |title=Cavs part with Davis in 3-for-3 trade |publisher=ESPN}}</ref>===2003–2010: The LeBron James era===[[Image:LebronFT.jpg|thumb|High school phenom James was selected 1st overall in 2003.]]Several losing seasons followed which saw the Cavaliers drop to the bottom of the league and become a perennial lottery draft team. After another disappointing season in [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03]], the Cavaliers landed the number one draft pick in the [[NBA Lottery]]. With it, the team selected local high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP [[LeBron James]]. As if celebrating a new era in Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, the team's colors were changed from orange, black and blue back to wine and gold, with the addition of navy blue and a new primary logo.James' status as both an area star (having played his high school basketball at [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School (Akron, Ohio)|St. Vincent-St. Mary High School]] in nearby [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]) and as one of the most highly touted prospects in NBA history has led many to view his selection as a turning point in the franchise's history.

Each team would suffer record-setting playoff defeats on home soil; the Celtics lost by 29, 124-95, in Game 3 (May 7), the greatest defeat in the history of the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, while the Cavaliers lost by 32, 120-88, in Game 5 (May 11).With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus then turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a one hour show named ''The Decision'' on [[ESPN]] that he would be signing with the [[Miami Heat]]. The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. A couple of LeBron James jerseys were burned, and the famous Nike "Witness" mural of James in downtown Cleveland was taken down. Shortly after James made his announcement, Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, announced in an open letter on the Cavaliers website that James' decision was a "cowardly betrayal" and promised a NBA championship for the Cleveland Cavaliers before LeBron James wins one. Despite being ridiculed for the letter by the media, Cleveland fans embraced the owner, even offering to pay the $100,000 fine given by the NBA.===2010–present: Rebuilding===During the 2010 offseason, the Cavaliers fired head coach [[Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)|Mike Brown]], along with most of their coaching staff. The General Manager [[Danny Ferry]] resigned on June 4, 2010. Chris Grant was promoted to replace Danny Ferry. The Cavaliers went over a month without a new head coach. On July 1, former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] guard and former [[New Jersey Nets]] and [[New Orleans Hornets]] head coach [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] was named the team's 18th head coach. With the hiring of Scott, the Cavaliers looked to build a squad with more of a team-oriented style of play instead of the superstar isolation style of play that no longer worked due to Lebron's departure to Miami Heat.   The Cavaliers spent the rest of the 2010 off-season rebuilding their team after James' departure. On July 23, they signed 2009 first-round pick [[Christian Eyenga]]. On July 26, the Cavs traded [[Delonte West]] and [[Sebastian Telfair]] to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for [[Ramon Sessions]], [[Ryan Hollins]] and a 2013 second round draft pick. On July 30, the Cavaliers signed free agent [[Joey Graham]] to a one-year, veteran's minimum contract with a team option for a second year. On August 16, the Cavs signed undrafted Jamaican rookie [[Samardo Samuels]] to a three-year, $2.3 million contract. On September 20, [[Jawad Williams]] and the Cavs decided to resign and reached a one-year $1.02 million contract. After finishing the [[2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2010 pre-season]] with a 6-2 record, the Cavs decided to waive [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]]<ref>[http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/roster_moves_101019.html]</ref> and sign with the undrafted rookie [[Manny Harris]], the Cavs also decided to exercise the fourth-year option with [[J.J.

[[Image:LebronFT.jpg|thumb|James was selected 1st overall in 2003.]]
Several losing seasons followed which saw the Cavaliers drop to the bottom of the league and become a perennial lottery draft team. After another disappointing season in [[2002â03 NBA season|2002â03]], the Cavaliers landed the number one draft pick in the [[NBA Lottery]]. With it, the team selected local high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP [[LeBron James]]. As if celebrating a new era in Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, the team's colors were changed from orange, black and blue back to wine and gold, with the addition of navy blue and a new primary logo.

James' status as both an area star (having played his high school basketball at [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School (Akron, Ohio)|St. Vincent-St. Mary High School]] in nearby [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]) and as one of the most highly touted prospects in NBA history has led many to view his selection as a turning point in the franchise's history. Embraced by Clevelanders as "King James,"  the [[2003â04 NBA season|2003â04]] season offered great hope for the future, as James rose to become a dominating player, winning the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]].  Hope was even greater for the [[2004â05 NBA season|2004â05]] season. James increased his production in terms of points, rebounds, and assists per game.  Despite [[Carlos Boozer free agency controversy|the loss of Carlos Boozer]] in the offseason, James teamed with [[Å½ydrÅ«nas Ilgauskas]] and [[Drew Gooden]] to form the core of the team.  After a promising start, the [[2004â05 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavs]] began a downward spiral that eventually led to the firing of coach [[Paul Silas]] and general manager [[Jim Paxson]].  The team failed to make the [[2005 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] that year, tied with [[New Jersey Nets]] for the final playoff spot with identical 42â40 records; however, the Nets owned the tiebreaker due to having the better head to head record vs the Cavs.

[[Image:QuickenLoansArena.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cleveland Cavaliers versus [[Chicago Bulls]] in the [[Quicken Loans Arena]] in 2006]]
The [[2005â06 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavaliers]] made many changes in the 2005 offseason.  Under new owner [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]], the team hired a new head coach, [[Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)|Mike Brown]], and a new general manager, former Cavaliers forward [[Danny Ferry]].  The team experienced success on the court in the [[2005â06 NBA season|following season]], clinching their first playoff appearance since [[1997â98 NBA season|1998]].  After a first round win over the [[2006â07 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]], the Cavaliers rebounded from a 0â2 deficit in the second round against the [[Detroit Pistons]], winning three consecutive games to come one game away from the conference finals. They lost a close Game 6 at home, and followed it with a 79â61 loss in Game 7.  The playoff rounds were a showcase for the emergence of LeBron James, who achieved many "youngest ever to..." records during the run.

The Cavs continued their success in the [[2006â07 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2006â07]] season. The team earned the second seed in the East with a 50â32 record, generating a series of favorable matchups in the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].  They battled 7th-seeded Wizards, who struggled with injuries near the end of the season.  The Cavaliers swept this series 4â0 , and defeated the [[New Jersey Nets]], 4â2, in the second round.

The Cavaliers faced the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.  After again losing the first two games at Detroit, the Cavaliers won the next three to take a 3â2 series lead.  This time, the Cavaliers eliminated Detroit in Game 6.  The wins included a 109â107 double-overtime game at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] in Game 5, in which LeBron James scored the last 25 points for the Cavs, and his performance in this game is recognized as one of the best in NBA history.  They continued to a dominant 98â82 win at home in Game 6.  Rookie [[Daniel Gibson|Daniel "Boobie" Gibson]] scored a career-high 31 points in the series clincher, and the franchise won its first ever Eastern Conference Championship.  

The team's first trip to the [[2007 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] was a short one, as they were outmatched and outplayed by the very strong [[San Antonio Spurs]], who swept the Cavs 4â0. <!-- [[Image:CavsGuitar.jpg|thumb|Cleveland Cavaliers guitar in front of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].]] -->

The [[2007â08 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cavs]] took a step back in the [[2007â08 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2007â08 season]].  They battled injuries and had many roster changes, including a three team trade at the trade deadline in which the team acquired F [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], G-F [[Wally Szczerbiak]], F-C [[Ben Wallace]], and G [[Delonte West]].  The Cavs finished 45â37 and lost in the second round against eventual champion Boston of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].  

In the 2008 off-season, the  team made a major change to its lineup, trading G Damon Jones and Smith (who later in the season rejoined  the Cavs after being released by [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Oklahoma City]]) for point guard [[Mo Williams]]. This trade was made in hopes of bringing another scorer to aid James.  

In the [[2008-09 Cleveland Cavaliers season|next season]], the Cavs made astounding progress. They finished with a record of 66â16, the winningest season in the franchise's history. The year marked other notable franchise records, including a 13-game winning streak, and road and home winning records. The Cavs entered the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] as the #1 seed in the NBA with home court advantage throughout the playoffs.  They finished the season 39â2 at home, one win short of the [[1985-86 Boston Celtics season|best all-time home record]]. Head Coach Mike Brown won [[NBA Coach of the Year]] honors and [[LeBron James]] finished second in the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] and won the [[NBA MVP]]. The Cavs began the 2009 postseason by sweeping the 8th-seeded [[2008â09 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] 4â0, winning every game by 10 or more points. In the conference semifinals, the Cavaliers faced the 4th-seeded [[2008â09 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]], who had defeated the [[2008â09 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] in seven games. Despite the Cavaliers' long layoff between the series they swept the Hawks 4â0, again winning each game by at least ten points, becoming the first team in NBA history to win eight straight playoff games by a double-digit margin.  

The Cavs then met the [[2008â09 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] in the Eastern Conference Finals.  The Cavs lost Game 1 of the series 107â106 at home despite James' 49-point effort.  Despite winning Game 2 by a score of 96â95, with the help of a James buzzer beating three-pointer, it was not enough as Orlando eventually took the series in 6 games. 

On June 25, 2009, 4-time NBA Champion and 15-time All-Star center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] was traded from the [[Phoenix Suns]] to the Cavaliers. The trade sent [[Ben Wallace]] and [[Sasha Pavlovic]] to Phoenix along with the 46th pick in the [[2010 NBA Draft]] and $500,000 in cash considerations.<ref>"ESPN", http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4285489, Retrieved June 24, 2009.</ref>

During the 2009 offseason, the Cavaliers signed wingman [[Anthony Parker]], and forwards [[Leon Powe]] and [[Jamario Moon]] for [[2009-10 Cleveland Cavaliers season|the following season]].  On February 17, 2010, the Cavaliers acquired All-Star forward [[Antawn Jamison]] from the [[Washington Wizards]] and [[Sebastian Telfair]] from the [[LA Clippers]] in a three way trade.  The Cavaliers originally lost [[Å½ydrÅ«nas Ilgauskas]] (center) in this trade, but after being waived by Washington, he signed back with the Cavaliers on March 23, 2010 for the rest of the 2009â2010 season.  The Cavaliers managed to finish with the NBA's best record for the second straight season, with a 61â21 record.  LeBron James was named the [[NBA MVP]], for the second consecutive year.  The Cavaliers defeated the [[Chicago Bulls]] 4â1 in the first round of the [[2010 NBA Playoffs]] but, in a huge upset, lost to the [[Boston Celtics]] after leading the series 2â1, with the Celtics proceeding to win 3 consecutive games (afterwards, the Celtics went to the [[2010 NBA Finals]] and lost to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 4â3.) Each team would suffer record-setting playoff defeats on home soil; the Celtics lost by 29, 124â95, in Game 3 (May 7), the greatest defeat in the history of the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, while the Cavaliers lost by 32, 120â88, in Game 5 (May 11).


With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus then turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a one hour show named ''The Decision'' on [[ESPN]] that he would be signing with the [[Miami Heat]]. The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.

Despite being ridiculed for the letter by the media, Cleveland fans embraced the owner, even offering to pay the $100,000 fine given by the NBA.

The '''Commonwealth Cup''' is an American [[college football]] [[College rivalry#ACC|rivalry game]] played between the [[Virginia Cavaliers football]] team of the [[University of Virginia]] and the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football]] team of [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].  Typically, this series is played on a Saturday close to [[Thanksgiving]].  The trophy is an important component of the greater [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]]. Though the two schools first met in 1895 and have played annually since 1970, the Cup is a relatively new tradition, beginning in 1996. Currently, Virginia Tech holds the cup, having won the 2011 matchup by the score of 38-0.  The Hokies have won eight consecutive games in the series.

Since the 1964 matchup, the game has always been played at either [[Lane Stadium]] or [[Scott Stadium]] on the campuses of the two universities.  But the series has at times been played in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] (1903, 1904, and 1957); [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] (1940, 1941, and 1942); and [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] (in 17 of the 19 years between 1945 and 1963).

Though the two schools first met in 1895 and have played annually since 1970, the Cup is a relatively new tradition, beginning in 1996. Currently, Virginia Tech holds the cup, having won the 2011 matchup by the score of 38-0.  The Hokies have won eight consecutive games in the series.  The Commonwealth Cup trophy itself is four feet high and contains the scores of all of the games in the Virginia-Virginia Tech series.<ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/trophy/commonwealth.html hokiesports.com]</ref>

Since the 1964 matchup, the game has always been played at either [[Lane Stadium]] or [[Scott Stadium]] on the campuses of the two universities.  But the series has at times been played in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] (1903, 1904, and 1957); [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] (1940, 1941, and 1942); and [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] (in 17 of the 19 years between 1945 and 1963).

Virginia Tech leads the all-time series between the schools 51-37-5,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/acc/virginia_tech/opponents_records.php?teamid=3385|title=Virginia Tech vs Virginia|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=2009-06-29}}
