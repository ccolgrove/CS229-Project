Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as in traditional Soviet style to make the vote unanimous). He was the only one of Khrushchev's colleagues to wish him well in his &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;retirement &lt;/span&gt;though he never spoke to him again. It is possible to speculate that this was because it would have been politically unwise to do so or because his patience for Khrushchev had gone by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;then. &lt;/span&gt;His decision to send flowers to his funeral in 1971, was perhaps due to guilt, some retained affection for Khrushchev or &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
