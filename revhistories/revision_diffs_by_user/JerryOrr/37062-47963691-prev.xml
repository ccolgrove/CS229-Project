  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Between 1915 and 1917, the IWW's Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) organized hundreds of thousands of migratory farm workers throughout the midwest and western United States, often signing up and organizing members in the field, in railyards and in hobo jungles. During this time, the IWW became synonymous with the hobo; migratory farmworkers could scarcely afford any other means of transportation to get to the next jobsite. Workers often won better working conditions by using direct action at the point of production, and striking &quot;on the job&quot; (consciously and collectively slowing their work). As a result of Wobbly organizing, conditions for migratory farm workers improved enormously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
