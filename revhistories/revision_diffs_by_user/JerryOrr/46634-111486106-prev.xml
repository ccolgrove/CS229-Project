During most of the retelling, the words &quot;THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE&quot; were superimposed on-screen.  However, it must be noted that as the original doctrine states that the aliens were placed around the volcanoes and eliminated by hydrogen bombs, the South Park episode claims the aliens were directly dropped into the volcanic [[lava]], and the thetans rose up in an effort to escape, but were then captured.  This may have been done on purpose in an attempt to thwart copyright &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The episode had been scheduled to be rebroadcast on [[15 March]] [[2006]]. However, [[Comedy Central]] did not air this specific episode, instead running an old episode which featured 'Chef' as the main character (Chef's [[Chocolate Salty Balls]]). According to the TV channel, the substitution was intended to pay tribute to [[Isaac Hayes]]. According to the makers of ''[[South Park]]'' ([[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]]), [[Viacom]] (the corporation that owns Comedy Central) replaced the episode because Scientology intervened and, more specifically, because Tom Cruise (himself a Scientologist who is lampooned in the episode for other reasons, as well) threatened distributor Paramount (also a Viacom affiliated company) with refusal to cooperate with the promotional campaign on the upcoming film [[Mission Impossible 3]]. This was denied by Cruise's representative. This press release, issued by Parker and Stone, was published in the entertainment newspaper &quot;Daily Variety&quot;: &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526757/20060321/index.jhtml?headlines=true&amp;amp;rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler| title=South Park' Cooks Up Plan For Chef In Season Premiere| date=2006-03-21| publisher=MTV News| accessdate=2006-10-05}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
