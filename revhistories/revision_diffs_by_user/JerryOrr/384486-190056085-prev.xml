  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pauline was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] as Harriet Wood, and moved with her family to live in [[Michigan]]. At the age of eighteen she decided she should go to [[New York City|New York]] to become an actress, where she changed her name to Cushman &amp;amp;ndash; a tribute, it is thought, to [[Charlotte Cushman]], a famous actress of the period whom she admired. She pursued the craft mainly in the [[Southern United States|South]] with little success, but she met and married with a musician named Charles Dickinson in New Orleans, and went to live with his family in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], where they had two children, Charles and Ida. Charles Senior was called to the war on the Union side and died in December 1862 as a result of the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;hostilities.She said,&quot; I'm a dum dum dumd umd head&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;.Dorkyface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Sources state that in 1879 she met Jere Fryer and moved to [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]], [[Arizona Territory]], where they married and operated a hotel and livery stable. He became the [[sheriff]] of [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]]. An adopted daughter died, and they separated in 1890. By 1892 she was living in poverty in [[El Paso, Texas]]. She had applied for back [[pension]] based on her first husband's military service, which was granted in June 1893. Her last days were spent in a boarding house in San Francisco, working as a seamstress and charwoman. Disabled from the effects of [[rheumatism]] and [[arthritis]], she became hooked on pain medicine, and on the night of the 1st of December 1893 she took an overdose of [[opium]], and was found the next morning by her landlady.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
