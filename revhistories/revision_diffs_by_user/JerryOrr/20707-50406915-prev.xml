  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Margaret Higgins Sanger''' ([[September 14]], [[1879]] &amp;amp;ndash; [[September 6]], [[1966]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[birth control]] activist, an advocate of certain aspects of [[eugenics]], and the founder of the [[American Birth Control League]] (which eventually became [[Planned Parenthood]]). Initially meeting with fierce opposition to her ideas, Sanger gradually won the support of the public and the courts for a woman's right to decide how and when she will bear children. Though her selective support of eugenics was less well received, Margaret Sanger was instrumental in opening the way to universal access to birth control.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger was born in [[Corning, New York|Corning]], [[New York]]. Her mother, Anne Purcell Higgins, was a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] who went through 18 pregnancies (with 11 live births)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Steinem.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; before dying of [[tuberculosis]] and [[cervical cancer]]. Sanger attended [[Claverack College]], a boarding school in [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]] for two years. Her sisters paid her tuition, and when they were unable to continue to provide this assistance, Sanger returned home in 1899. Her mother died the same year, after which Sanger enrolled in a nursing program at a hospital in [[White Plains]], an affluent New York suburb. In 1902, she married William Sanger. Although stricken by tuberculosis, she gave birth to a son the following year, followed in later years by a second son and a daughter who died in childhood. Sanger's ill health, marriage and subsequent pregnancy prevented her from completing her third year of training and attaining a certification, though her new husband assured her that he would care for her and that she would be better off raising their children than pursuing a career.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;chesler&quot;&amp;gt;Chesler.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1912, Sanger and her family moved to [[New York City]], where she went to work in the poverty-stricken [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|East Side]] slums of [[Manhattan]]. That same year, she also started writing a column for the ''New York Call'' entitled &quot;What Every Girl Should Know.&quot; Distributing a pamphlet, ''Family Limitation'', to poor women, Sanger repeatedly risked scandal and imprisonment by acting in defiance of the [[Comstock Law|Comstock Law of 1873]] which outlawed as [[obscene]] the dissemination of contraceptive information and devices.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1914, Sanger launched ''The Woman Rebel'', a newspaper advocating birth control. She also separated from William Sanger in 1913. In 1916, Sanger opened a family planning and birth control clinic in the Brownsville neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], the first of its kind in the United States. It was raided by the police and Sanger was arrested for violating the post office's obscenity laws by sending birth control information by mail. Sanger fled to [[Europe]] to escape prosecution. There, she had an affair with the famous science-fiction author, [[H. G. Wells]].  The following year, she returned to the U.S. and resumed her activities, launching the periodical ''The Birth Control Review and Birth Control News''. She also contributed articles on health for the [[United States Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] paper, ''The Call''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1916, Sanger published &quot;What Every Girl Should Know,&quot; which was later widely distributed as one of the [[E. Haldeman-Julius]] &quot;[[Little Blue Books]].&quot; It not only provided basic information about such topics as [[menstruation]], but also promoted an understanding of sexuality in adolescents. It was followed in 1917 by ''What Every Mother Should Know''. That year, Sanger was sent to the workhouse for &quot;creating a [[public nuisance]].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger founded the [[American Birth Control League]] (ABCL) in 1921 with [[Lothrop Stoddard]] and [[C. C. Little]]. In 1922, she traveled to [[Japan]] to work with Japanese feminist [[Kato Shidzue]] promoting birth control; over the next several years, she would return another six times for this purpose. In this year, she also married oil tycoon James Noah H. Slee. In 1923, under the auspices of the ABCL, she established the Clinical Research Bureau. It was the first legal birth control clinic in the U.S. (renamed Margaret Sanger Research Bureau in her honor in 1940). That year, she also formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control and served as its president of until its dissolution in 1937 after birth control under medical supervision was legalized in many states. In 1927, Sanger helped organize the first [[World Population Conference]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1928, Sanger resigned as the president of the ABCL. Two years later, she became president of the Birth Control International Information Center. In January 1932, she addressed the [[New History Society]], an organization founded by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] and [[Julia Lynch Olin|Julie Chanler]]; this address would later become the basis for an article entitled ''A Plan for Peace''.&amp;lt;ref name=pouzzner&amp;gt;Pouzzner.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1937, Sanger became chairperson of the Birth Control Council of America and launched two publications, ''The Birth Control Review'' and ''The Birth Control News''. From 1939 to 1942, she was an honorary delegate of the Birth Control Federation of America. From 1952 to 1959, she served as president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation; at the time, the largest private international family planning organization.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the 1960 presidential elections, Sanger was dismayed by candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]'s position on birth control (Kennedy did not believe birth control should be a matter of government policy). She threatened to leave the country if Kennedy were elected, but evidently reconsidered after Kennedy won the election.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the early 1960s, Sanger promoted the use of the newly available [[birth control pill]]. She toured Europe, Africa, and Asia, lecturing and helping to establish clinics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger died in 1966 in [[Tucson, Arizona]] at age 87 only a few months after the landmark [[Griswold v. Connecticut]] decision, which legalized birth control for married couples in the US. It was the apex of her fifty-year struggle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger's books include ''Woman and the New Race'' (1920), ''Happiness in Marriage'' (1926), and an autobiography (1938).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
