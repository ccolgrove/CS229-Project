Some examples given include the sale of supercomputers to China (which could be used for military applications). Many Blue Team members cite the lack of democracy in China as the key concern and claim that the PRC will use nationalism (painting the US and Japan as the enemies) to consolidate power and distract the people from democracy and human rights. Similarly, they claim that a lack of democracy in China gives the PRC government more political will to warmonger, enabling it to challenge US power in East Asia. Some even see the lack of China's transparency as deceptive; US officials have long complained that China was unwilling to reciprocate on military and intelligence sharing, resorting commonly to charades or &quot;parades&quot; in order to deceive foreign nations on its capabilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
