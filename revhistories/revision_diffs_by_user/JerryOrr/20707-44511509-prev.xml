  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although Sanger's views on abortion (like many of her opinions) changed throughout the course of her life, in her early years she was acutely aware of the problem of abortion, typically self-induced or with the aid of a [[midwife]]. Her opposition to abortion stemmed primarily from a concern for the dangers to the mother, and less so from legal concerns or the welfare of the unborn child. She wrote in a 1916 edition of ''Family Limitation,'' &quot;no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable,&quot; though she framed this in the context of her birth control advocacy, adding that &quot;abortions will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception. (Care is) the only cure for abortions.&quot; Sanger consistently regarded birth control and abortion as the responsibility and burden first and foremost of women, and as matters of law, medicine and public policy second.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gray.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
