  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The industries developed in Paterson were powered by the 77-foot high Great Falls, and a system of water raceways that harnessed the power of the falls. The city began growing around the falls and until 1914 the mills were powered by the waterfalls. The district originally included dozens of mill buildings and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry and later, the firearms, silk, and railroad locomotive manufacturing industries. In the latter half of the 1800s, [[silk]] production became the dominant industry and formed the basis of Paterson's most prosperous period, earning it the nickname &quot;Silk City.&quot; In 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in Paterson, although within a few years he moved his business to [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Later in the 19th century, Paterson was the site of early experiments with submarines by inventor [[John Holland]]. Two of Holland's early models &amp;amp;mdash; one found at the bottom of the Passaic River &amp;amp;mdash; are on display in the Paterson Museum, housed in a former mill near the Passaic Falls.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The city was a mecca for immigrant laborers who worked in its factories as well. Paterson was also the site of historic labor unrest that focused on anti-child labor legislation, and the six-month long &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[1913 Paterson &lt;/span&gt;silk &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;strike]] &lt;/span&gt;that demanded the [[eight-hour day]] and better working conditions, but was defeated by the employers with workers forced to return under pre-strike conditions. Factory workers labored long hours for low wages under dangerous conditions and lived in crowded tenement buildings around the mills. The factories then moved south where there were no labor unions and later overseas. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1932, Paterson opened [[Hinchliffe Stadium]], a 7,500-seat stadium named in honor of John V. Hinchliffe, a former Paterson mayor. Hinchliffe originally served as the site for high school and semi-professional athletic events. From 1933 to 1945, Hinchliffe became the home of the [[New York Black Yankees]] of the [[Negro National League]], as well as the venue for many football games, track and field events, boxing matches and shows, including those done by [[Abbott and Costello]]. In the 1970s, Paterson Public Schools acquired the stadium and utilized it for public school events until the 1997. Currently, Hinchliffe stadium is in a state of disrepair. However, Hinchliffe is one of only two [[Negro League]] stadiums left standing in the [[United States]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
