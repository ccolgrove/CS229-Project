  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[November 4]]th 2005, on [[ESPN]], Terrell Owens criticized the Eagles [[front office]] for not recognizing his 100th touchdown catch. He also agreed with [[Michael Irvin]]'s statement that the Eagles would be undefeated had [[Brett Favre]] been the quarterback. Owens apologized the next day to the front office (but not to McNabb) and was suspended indefinitely. There were also reports that he got into a fist fight with [[Hugh Douglas]] and challenged other players in the locker room which contributed to his suspension. At Andy Reid's press conference after the Washington loss, he announced T.O. would no longer be playing this year for the Eagles due to conduct detrimental to the team. The Eagles would proceed to lose the next three games to the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]], Cowboys, and Giants, risking not making the playoffs for the first time since [[1999]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Former [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]] quarterback Mike McMahon is currently starting for the Eagles.
