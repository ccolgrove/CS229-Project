  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger remains a controversial figure. While she is widely credited as a leader of the modern birth control movement, and remains an iconic figure for the American [[reproductive rights]] movements, she also is reviled by some who condemn her as &quot;an abortion advocate&quot; (perhaps unfairly so: [[abortion]] was illegal during Sanger's lifetime and Planned Parenthood did not then support the procedure or lobby for its legalisation) or those who disagree in principle with Eugenics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
