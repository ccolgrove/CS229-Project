The &quot;Bully&quot; sterotype is always there, and aplified greatly by the &lt;/span&gt;national &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;media.  Yes, there has been instances, no more than other NFL teams IE NY Jets/Giants, Pittsburg Steelers, Okland Raiders, and so on.  You will always here a fabricted horror story about &lt;/span&gt;Eagles fans &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;from pulling &lt;/span&gt;a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;gun, to eating an opposing's fans baby which we Fans like to call the Gargoyle Syndrome.  With the NFC East reforming into the powerhouse it once was, the Philadelphia Eagles are right back &lt;/span&gt;in &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;the bloddy battles with Washington, New York and Dallas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Poor judgment and alcohol have occasionally led some &lt;/span&gt;Eagles fans &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;to transgress &lt;/span&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;boundaries of civilized behavior. Such behavior is familiar to many who have attended professional sporting events virtually anywhere &lt;/span&gt;in the world, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;but Eagles fans have had &lt;/span&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;misfortune &lt;/span&gt;to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;misbehave in numerous high profile moments, many on &lt;/span&gt;national &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;television. As such, &lt;/span&gt;Eagles fans &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;have &lt;/span&gt;a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;reputation &lt;/span&gt;in &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;many quarters as being unduly rowdy, or even dangerous. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Local radio hosts had recruited the boorishly behaving crew to protest the selection, which turned out to be future Pro-Bowl quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]]. McNabb stayed composed during the incident, and the thirty or so fans who booed him were subsequently derided as the &quot;Dirty Thirty,&quot; while the radio hosts in question were widely criticized for their roles as instigators. McNabb has since become one of Philadelphia's most beloved sports icons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
