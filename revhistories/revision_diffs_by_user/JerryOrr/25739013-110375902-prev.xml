  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was speculated that computer programs could stop working or produce erroneous results because they stored years with only two digits and that the year 2000 would be represented by ''00'' and would be interpreted by software as the year [[1900]].  This would cause date comparisons to produce incorrect results. It was also thought that [[embedded systems]], making use of similar date logic, might fail and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
