Furthermore, the AFL disdained to organize workers who were not skilled. But Haywood had become convinced by the experiences of striking railroad workers that a different union philosophy, some form of [[Industrial unionism|industrial unionism]] was necessary for workers to obtain justice. This became apparent when the craft-organized locomotive firemen kept their engines running, helping their employers to break a strike called by the railroad engineers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;For Haywood, industrial union principles were later confirmed by the defeat of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] in the 1903-05 Cripple Creek strike due-- he believed-- to insufficient labor solidarity. The WFM miners had sought to extend the benefits of union to the mill workers who processed their ore. Since the government had crushed the ARU, the railroad workers were again organized along craft lines under the AFL. Those same railroad unions continued to haul the ore ''from mines'' that were run by strike breakers, ''to mills'' that were run by strike breakers. &quot;The railroaders form the connecting link in the proposition that is scabby at both ends,&quot; Haywood complained. &quot;This fight, which is entering its third year, could have been won in three weeks if it were not for the fact that the trade unions are  lending assistance to the mine &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;operators.&quot;&amp;lt;Ref&amp;gt;Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pp. &lt;/span&gt;80.&amp;lt;/Ref&amp;gt; The obvious solution, it seemed to Haywood, was for all of the workers to join the same union, and to take collective action in concert against the employers. The militants of the WFM referred to the AFL as the &quot;American ''Separation'' of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Labor,&quot;&amp;lt;Ref&amp;gt;Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pp. &lt;/span&gt;81.&amp;lt;/Ref&amp;gt; a criticism that was later echoed by the Industrial Workers of the World.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
