  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Philadelphia football struggled through the [[Marion Campbell]] years of the mid 1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. In 1986, the arrival of head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base. From 1988 to 1996, the Eagles qualified for the playoffs during 6 out of those 9 seasons, but they won the [[NFC East]] only once, in 1988. Among the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]], tight end [[Keith Jackson (football player)|Keith Jackson]], and running back [[Keith Byars]]. But the &quot;Gang Green&quot; defense is what defined the team, led by [[Reggie White]], [[Jerome Brown]], [[Clyde Simmons]], [[Seth Joyner]], [[Wes Hopkins]], [[Byron Evans]], [[Eric Allen]], and [[Andre Waters]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

From that time on the team continually improved, returning to the playoffs in 2000, then succeeding in winning the [[NFC East]] and playing in four consecutive conference championship games between 2001 and 2004.  After losing the conference championship in 2001 to the [[St. Louis Rams]], in 2002 to the eventual Super Bowl Champions [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and 2003 to the [[Carolina Panthers]], the Eagles finally advanced to the Super Bowl again in 2004, [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], where they were defeated by the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;CHEATING &lt;/span&gt;[[New England Patriots]], 24-21.  Following a 2005 season marred by injuries and controversy among its star players, the Eagles returned to the playoffs in 2006 with an improbable run of 5 consecutive wins to end the season, bringing the team its fifth [[NFC East]] title under Coach Reid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
