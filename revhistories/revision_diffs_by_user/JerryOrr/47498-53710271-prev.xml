  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The well-known quotations were taken from the [[Europe]]an localization of the [[Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] [[Porting|port]] released in 1992. The arcade version of ''Zero Wing'' does not include the quote, though it does include an equally butchered ending; the intro for the [[PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16|PC Engine]] version has [[Compact disc|CD]]-quality spoken dialogue but has a completely different introduction. ''Zero Wing'' was never released in [[North America]] and therefore never came to the [[Sega Genesis]], the North American version of the Mega Drive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;AYB &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;is interesting because it &lt;/span&gt;demonstrated the Internet's power to spread [[wikt:idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] messages rapidly that would never have been covered by the traditional mass media. Although the fad has died down, the phrase continues to be one of the most commonly quoted examples of &quot;[[Engrish]].&quot; The phrase is also often used as a [[battle cry]] on many competitive video games, particularly ones played over the [[Internet]]. ''[[Guild Wars]]'' has even made it a skill for the warrior class, where the character shouts &quot;For Great Justice!&quot; (a reference to another quote from ''Zero Wing'', &quot;Move 'zig.' For great justice.&quot;) and thereby causes adrenaline to gain 50% faster for a short while.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;AYB is often cited as an example of a [[meme]], a self-propagating thought, idea, or message, because of its broad, rapid spread across the Internet and around the world. It has also been recognized as a [[snowclone]], wherein a familiar phrase is modified by substituting new words into the phrase (for example, &quot;All your bug are belong to me&quot; as used on Wikipedia's [http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/ MediaZilla main page]).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
