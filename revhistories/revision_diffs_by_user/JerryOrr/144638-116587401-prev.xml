  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;March 1986 saw Union Carbide propose a settlement figure, endorsed by plaintiffsâ US attorneys, of $350 million that would, according to the company, âgenerate a fund for Bhopal victims of between $500-600 million over 20 yearsâ. In May, litigiation was transferred from the US to Indian courts by US District Court Judge. Following an appeal of this decision, the US Court of Appeals affirmed the transfer, judging, in January 1987, that UCIL was a âseparate entity, owned, managed and operated exclusively by Indian citizens in Indiaâ&amp;lt;ref name=UCC1/&amp;gt;. The judge in the US, Judge Keenan, granted Carbideâs forum request, thus moving the case to India. This meant that, under US federal law, the company had to submit to Indian jurisdiction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Throughout 1990, the Indian Supreme Court heard appeals against the settlement from âactivist petitionsâ. Nonetheless, in October 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the origingal $470 million, dismissing any other outstanding petitions that challenged the original decision. The decision set aside a âportion of settlement that quashed criminal prosecutions that were pending at the time of settlementâ. The Court ordered the Indian government âto purchase, out of settlement fund, a group medical insurance policy to cover 100,000 persons who may later develop symptomsâ and cover any shortfall in the settlement fund. It also ârequestsâ that Carbide and its subsidiary âvoluntarilyâ fund a hospital in Bhopal, at an estimate $17 million, to specifically treat victims of the Bhopal disaster.
