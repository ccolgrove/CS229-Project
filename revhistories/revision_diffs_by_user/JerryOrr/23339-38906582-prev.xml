In the last quarter, one fan fired a [[flare gun]] across the stadium into empty seats in the 700 level.  Fans entering home Eagles games have been subject to pat-down searches at entry by stadium security ever since.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Local radio hosts had recruited the boorishly behaving crew to protest the selection, which turned out to be future Pro-Bowl quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]].  McNabb stayed composed during the incident, and the thirty or so fans who booed him were subsequently derided as the &quot;Dirty Thirty,&quot; while the radio hosts in question were widely criticized for their roles as instigators.  McNabb has since become one of Philadelphia's most beloved sports icons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
