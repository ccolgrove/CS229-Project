  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since governments expect more income in the future, they start accumlating debt, even though they are receiving &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;oil &lt;/span&gt;revenues as well. This is encouraged, since, if the real exchange rate increases, through capital inflows or the [[Dutch disease]], this makes the interest payments on the debt cheaper. In addition, the country's natural resources act as collateral leading to more credit. However, if &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;oil &lt;/span&gt;prices begin to fall, and if the real exchange rate falls, a government would have less money with which to pay a relatively more expensive debt. For example, many oil-rich countries like Nigeria and Venezuela saw rapid expansions of their debt burdens during the 1970s oil boom; however, when oil prices fell back in the 1980s, bankers stopped lending to them and many of them fell into arrears, triggering penalty interest charges that made their debts grow even more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
