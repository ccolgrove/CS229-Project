The government had only the testimony of Orchard, the confessed bomber, to implicate Haywood and the other defendants, and Orchard's checkered past and admitted violent history was skillfully exploited by Darrow.&amp;lt;ref name=linder /&amp;gt; During the trial Orchard admitted that he had acted as a paid informant of the Mine Owner's Association,&amp;lt;Ref&amp;gt;Carlson, 119.&amp;lt;/Ref&amp;gt; in effect working for both sides. After Darrow's final summation (which moved many in the courtroom to tears&amp;lt;ref name=linder /&amp;gt;), the jury acquitted Haywood. Darrow was ill, however, and withdrew from the subsequent trial of George Pettibone, leaving Judge Hilton of Denver in charge of the defense. After a second jury acquitted Pettibone, the charges against Moyer were dropped.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
