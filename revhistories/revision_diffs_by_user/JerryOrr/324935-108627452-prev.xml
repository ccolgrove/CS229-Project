The government had only the testimony of Orchard, the confessed bomber, to implicate Haywood and the other defendants, and Orchard's checkered past and admitted violent history was skillfully exploited by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Darrow. &lt;/span&gt;After Darrow's final summation (which moved some jurors to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;tears), &lt;/span&gt;the jury acquitted Haywood. Darrow was ill, however, and withdrew from the subsequent trial against George Pettibone, leaving Judge Hilton of Denver in charge. After the second jury acquitted Pettibone, the charges against Moyer were dropped.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
