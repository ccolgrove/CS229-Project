  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Advocates for Mararet Sanger's contend that her eugenic policies tied in with her primary cause of birth control, which she saw as a means to prevent &quot;dysgenic&quot; children from being born and living a disadvantaged life. While many leaders in the eugenics movement were calling for active euthanasia of the &quot;unfit,&quot; Sanger did not share such views. Edwin Black writes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Margaret Sanger was well aware that her fellow birth control advocates were promoting lethal chambers, but she herself rejected the idea completely.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger remains a controversial figure. While she is widely credited as a leader of the modern birth control movement, and remains an iconic figure for the American [[reproductive rights]] movements, she also is reviled by some who condemn her as &quot;an abortion advocate&quot; (perhaps unfairly so: [[abortion]] was illegal during Sanger's lifetime and Planned Parenthood did not then support the procedure or lobby for its legalisation) or those who disagree in principle with Eugenics. Groups opposed to Planned Parenthood and/or legalized abortion have frequently targeted Sanger for her views, attributing her efforts to promote birth control to a desire to &quot;purify&quot; the human race through eugenics, and even to eliminate minority races by placing birth control clinics in minority neighborhoods.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Citizen Magazine.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For this reason, Sanger is often quoted selectively or out of context by detractors (a practice known as [[quote mining]]), and her history and involvement with socialism and eugenics have often been rationalized or even ignored by her defenders and biographers (a practice known as [[Spin (public relations)|spin doctoring]]). Despite the allegations of racism, Sanger's work with minorities earned the respect of civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Planned Parenthood Federation of America.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In their biographical article about Margaret Sanger, [[Planned Parenthood]] notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although Sanger's views on abortion (like many of her opinions) changed throughout the course of her life, in her early years she was acutely aware of the problem of abortion, typically self-induced or with the aid of a [[midwife]]. Her opposition to abortion stemmed primarily from a concern for the dangers to the mother, and less so from legal concerns or the welfare of the unborn child. She wrote in a 1916 edition of ''Family Limitation,'' &quot;no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable,&quot; though she framed this in the context of her birth control advocacy, adding that &quot;abortions will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception. (Care is) the only cure for abortions.&quot; Sanger consistently regarded birth control and abortion as the responsibility and burden first and foremost of women, and as matters of law, medicine and public policy second.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gray.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although the problems of eugenics were not anticipated and Sanger ultimately did not support Nazi use of gas &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;chambers for eugenics &lt;/span&gt;she &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;did support &lt;/span&gt;the movement that led to this. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Certainly, there were fears that it would lead to problems, which is why birth control was always controversial. Some &lt;/span&gt;of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;her supporters currently would claim she supported &quot;good eugenics&quot;, but &lt;/span&gt;eugenics &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;is illegal today because it is not so easy to divide up into &quot;good&quot; &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;&quot;bad&quot;. What actually happened (not only in Nazi Germany) is certain groups were targeted based on the bigotry of others. For instance, in China &lt;/span&gt;the numbers of males is far greater than females because of their &quot;one child&quot; policy and the ability to abort the non-prefered &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;sex. Sanger certainly would not be happy about this ironic twist. Considering the growing power of China it could be her ultimate legacy, and could influence the entire world as these &quot;extra&quot; 100 million males decide to raid smaller countries. (Ghengis Khan had perhaps the first major eugenics policy.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
