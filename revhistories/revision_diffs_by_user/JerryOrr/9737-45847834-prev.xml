  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] was infamous for eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a &quot;pure&quot; German race through a series of programs which ran under the banner of &quot;[[racial hygiene]].&quot; Among other activities, the Nazis performed extensive experimentation on live human beings to test their genetic theories, ranging from simple measurement of physical characteristics to the more ghastly experiments carried out by [[Josef Mengele]] for [[Otmar von Verschuer]] on twins in the concentration camps. During the 1930s and 1940s the Nazi regime forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of people whom they viewed as mentally and physically &quot;unfit&quot;, an estimated 400,000 between 1934 and 1937. The scale of the Nazi program prompted American eugenics advocates to seek an expansion of their &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;program &lt;/span&gt;with one &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;complained &lt;/span&gt;that 'the Germans are beating us at our own game.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Quoted in Selgelid, Michael J. 2000.

''Monash Bioethics Review'' 19 (4):9-33&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Nazi's went further however, killing tens of thousands of the institutionalized disabled through compulsory &quot;[[euthanasia]]&quot; programs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Nazi eugenics policies are discussed in a number of sources. A few of the more definitive ones are Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988) and Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, DC: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004) ([http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/deadlymedicine/ online exhibit]).
