  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Poor judgment and alcohol have occasionally led some Eagles fans to transgress the boundaries of civilized behavior.  Some such behavior is familiar to many who have attended professional sporting events virtually anywhere in the world, but Eagles fans have had the misfortune to misbehave in numerous high profile moments, many on national television.  As such, Eagles fans have a reputation in many quarters as being unduly rowdy, or even dangerous.  Some instances of fan misconduct stand out for their sheer outlandishness, and the atmosphere at Eagles home games bears greater similarity to the intense atmosphere at European soccer stadiums than it does the typical American sporting event; in fact, Eagles fans have been compared unfavorably to European soccer hooligans by the media [http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,1660884,00.html?gusrc=rss]. However, though their behavior is generally looked upon unfavorably, Eagles fans &quot;are often considered to be among the most passionate in professional sports&quot; [http://www.canbet.com/whatsnew/philadelphia-eagles-history.aspx].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The most (in)famous example of fan impropriety at Eagles games is the so-called &quot;Santa Claus Incident,&quot; on [[December 15]], [[1968]], at [[Franklin Field]], in which angry fans, furious at the conclusion of yet another wasted season under head coach [[Joe Kuharich]] (including losing their first 11 games, then winning the next two, preventing the team from getting the first pick in the next year's draft, [[O.J. Simpson]]), booed and threw [[snowball]]s at a man dressed as Santa Claus during the halftime &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;show.  The original Santa had stayed home due to the snowfall, leading the club to draft 20 year-old Frank Olivo from the stands as an ad hoc replacement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
