  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Timothy Kealii'okaaina Awa Chang''' (born [[October 9]], [[1981]] in Waipahu, [[Hawaii]], [[United States|USA]]) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] in the [[University of Hawaii]] for the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].  He currently holds the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;|NCAA &lt;/span&gt;Division I-A all-time passing yards record with 17,072, surpassing [[Ty Detmer]] of [[BYU]] in 2004.  He also holds records for total offensive yards (17,183), most offensive plays (2,610), most interceptions (77) and is second to Detmer's 121 Touchdown passes (117).  He was a four-year starter who shattered most school QB records, but was seen by critics as a system QB who used a passing-dominated playbook to his advantage.  He was signed by the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] in [[2005]], but was cut in training camp and played in the preseason for the [[Detroit Lions]] but didn't make the final roster.  At just 6'2&quot; and 194 pounds, most think he is not big enough to survive in professional [[football]] despite his college stats. Most critics feel that Chang would fair better in more of a west coast offensive like those featured in the [[Arena Football League]] or the [[Canadian Football League]].  If he were to play in the NFL, he would be the league's first ever quarterback of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] descent (he is of Hawaiian, Chinese, Puerto Rican, English, Irish and Spanish&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
