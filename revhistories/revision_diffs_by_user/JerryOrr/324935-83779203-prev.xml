  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Haywood's trial began on [[May 9]], [[1907]], with famed Chicago defense attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] defending him.  The government had only the testimony of Orchard, the confessed bomber, to implicate Haywood and the other defendants, and Orchard's checkered past and admitted violent history was skillfully exploited by Darrow.  After Darrow's final summation (which moved some jurors to tears), the jury acquitted him, along with Pettibone, and the charges against Moyer were dropped.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Despite the efforts of his supporters, Haywood was unable to overturn the conviction. In 1921, Haywood skipped bail while out on appeal and fled to [[Russia]], causing friends who had posted his bond to lose their security.  In Russia, Haywood became an advisor to Lenin's [[Bolshevik]] government.  Unfortunately, Lenin's illness and death and Stalin's rise to power ended his role as an advisor to the Soviet labor movement, and he spent the last years of his life an alcoholic, alone and isolated.  Haywood died in [[Moscow]] in 1928.  His early death may have been providential in a sense, as Stalin's secret police, the [[NKVD]], later began rounding up and executing foreign nationals on suspicion of espionage. Half of his ashes were buried in [[the Kremlin]] and an urn containing the other half of his ashes was sent to Chicago and buried near a monument to the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket anarchists]].&amp;lt;ref name=linder /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unlike many labor leaders and organizations of the time, Haywood believed that workers of all ethnicities should work together. According to Haywood, the IWW was &quot;big enough to take in the black man, the white man; big enough to take in all nationalities - an organization that will be strong enough to obliterate state boundaries; to obliterate national boundaries.&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=orth&amp;gt;Orth.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
