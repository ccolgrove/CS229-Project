  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mott Haven was the first neighborhood to give rise to the term &quot;South Bronx&quot;. In the 1940s when the Bronx was usually divided into the East Bronx and West Bronx, a group of social workers identified a pocket of poverty in Mott Haven and called it the South Bronx. The pocket of poverty would spread in part due to [[Robert Moses]] building several housing projects in the neighborhood such as John Purroy Mitchel, Mott Haven, Millbrook, and Lester Patterson Houses. This pocket of poverty greatly expanded northward, following the post-war phenomenon colloquially referred to as [[white flight]], reaching a peak in the 1970s when the North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. Today the North Bronx-South Bronx distinction remains more common than the traditional East Bronx-West Bronx distinction, and some still regard [[Fordham Road]] or the infamous [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] as the boundary. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
