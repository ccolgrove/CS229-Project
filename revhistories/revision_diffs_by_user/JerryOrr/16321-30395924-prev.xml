  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;From [[1950]] to [[1953]], McCarthy continued to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks, which increased his approval rating and gained him a powerful national following. His finances were investigated by a Senate panel in [[1952]]; its report cited questionable behavior in his campaigns and irregularities in his finances, but found no grounds for legal action. He married Jean Kerr, a researcher in his office, on September 29, 1953.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;McCarthy's charges of &quot;Communist influences&quot; within the government probably aided the Republican Party's fortunes in the 1952 elections; it is probable that the defeat of more than one Democratic candidate for national office in 1952 was due at least in part to accusations against him by McCarthy. The party leadership, recognizing his immense popularity and his value as a stick with which to beat &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[liberal]] &lt;/span&gt;Democrats, appointed him chairman of the [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]]. His unreliability and evasiveness, however, meant he was never completely trusted by the party (and particularly by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who once said privately that he didn't &quot;want to get into a pissing contest with that skunk!&quot;) One of McCarthy's higher-profile targets was General [[George C. Marshall]]. McCarthy and Senator [[William Jenner]] of [[Indiana]] accused Marshall of [[treason]]. Eisenhower wrote a speech in which he included a spirited defense of General Marshall, but he was later convinced to remove this passage. Truman turned bitterly against Eisenhower because of this, calling Eisenhower a coward because he owed his career to General Marshall. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
