  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Following the [[First World War]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] forced Germany to pay significant reparations (compensation) to the nations that won the war, starting in 1919. However, Germany had a very weak economy at this time: in effect, the young republic of Weimar had no money. To pay its reparations and rebuild the economy, the German government printed  money. However, there was no faith in this money, and the hyperinflation began. The inflation reached its peak by November 1923, but ended when a new currency (the [[Rentenmark]]) was introduced. The government stated this new currency had a fixed value, and this was accepted. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
