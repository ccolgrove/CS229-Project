  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The coffee industry grew inexorably in El Salvador. As a result the elite provided the bulk of the government's financial support through [[import]] [[duty|duties]] on goods imported with the foreign [[currency|currencies]] that coffee sales earned. This support, coupled with the humbler and more mundane mechanisms of [[corruption]], ensured the coffee growers of overwhelming influence within the [[government]] and the [[military]] which they used to create the Guardia Nacional (GN) in [[1912]]. The duties of the GN differed from those of the Policia Nacional (PN), mainly in that GN personnel were specifically responsible for providing security on the coffee fincas and effectively [[Suppression of dissent|suppressing rural dissent]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
