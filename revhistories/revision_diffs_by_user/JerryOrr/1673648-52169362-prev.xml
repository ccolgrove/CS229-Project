It also drew on the earlier work of activists in the [[settlement house]] movement, such as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Florence Kelley]], and budding unions in industries with a large number of women workers, such as garments and textiles. The leadership was made up of both upper-class philanthropists and working class women with experience organizing unions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Some observers made light of the upper-class women members of the WTUL who picketed alongside garment workers, calling them the &quot;mink brigade&quot;. These distinctions split strikers from their upper-class benefactors as well: a contingent of strikers challenged [[Alva Belmont]] concerning her reasons for supporting the strike.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The strike was, however, less than wholly successful: [[Italy|Italian]] workers crossed the picket lines in large numbers and the strikers lacked the resources to hold out longer than the employers. In addition, although activists within the WTUL, including William E. Walling and Lillian D. Wald, were also among the founders of the [[NAACP]] that year and fought the employers' plan to use [[African-American]] strikebreakers to defeat the strike, others in the black community actively encouraged black workers to cross the picket lines. Even so, the strike produced some limited gains for workers, while giving both the WTUL and women garment workers a practical education in organizing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
