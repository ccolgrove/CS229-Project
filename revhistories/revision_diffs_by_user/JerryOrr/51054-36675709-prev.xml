  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Black bears prefer forested and shrubby areas but use wet [[meadow]]s, high tidelands, ridgetops, burned areas, riparian areas, and avalanche chutes.  They also frequent swampy hardwood and conifer forests. After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they seek southerly slopes at lower elevations for forage and move to northerly and easterly slopes at higher elevations as summer progresses. Black bears use dense &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;cover  kyle hartman  &lt;/span&gt;and thermal protection, as well as for bedding.  They climb trees to escape danger and use forested areas as travel corridors.  Black bears hibernate during winter and may build dens in tree cavities, under logs, rocks, in banks, caves, or culverts, and in shallow depressions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Black bears reach [[breeding]] maturity at about 4 or 5 years of age, and breed every 2 to 3 years. Black bears breed in the spring, usually in May and June, but the embryos do not begin to develop until the mother dens in the fall to [[Hibernation|hibernate]] through the winter months (delayed implantation.) However, if food was scarce and the mother has not gained enough fat to sustain herself during hibernation as well as produce cubs, the embryos do not implant (develop). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
