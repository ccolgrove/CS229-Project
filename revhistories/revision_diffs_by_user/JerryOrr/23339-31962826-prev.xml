  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Poor judgment and alcohol have occasionally led some Eagles fans to transgress the boundaries of civilized behavior.  Some such behavior is familiar to many who have attended professional sporting events virtually anywhere in the world, but Eagles fans have had the misfortune to misbehave in numerous high profile moments, many on national television.  As such, Eagles fans have a reputation in many quarters as being unduly rowdy, or even dangerous.  Some instances of fan misconduct stand out for their sheer outlandishness, and the atmosphere at Eagles home games bears greater similarity to the intense atmosphere at European soccer stadiums than it does the typical American sporting event; in fact, Eagles fans have been compared unfavorably to European soccer hooligans by the media [http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,1660884,00.html?gusrc=rss].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Simpson]]), booed and threw [[snowball]]s at a man dressed as Santa Claus during the halftime show.  The original Santa had &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;stayed home due &lt;/span&gt;to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;the snowfall, &lt;/span&gt;leading the club to draft 20 year-old Frank Olivo from the stands as an ad hoc replacement.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As Olivo recounts, fans threw snowballs at him after he reached the end zone, shouting that he made a poor Santa.

This led to more snowballs.  Subsequently, [[Howard Cosell]] exaggerated the tale, and a legend was &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;born.&amp;lt;!--Is there a source stating what exactly Cosell said?--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Olivo, in turn, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;laughed the snowballs off and &lt;/span&gt;pointed to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;the few culprits, &lt;/span&gt;instructing them that they'd have empty stockings that Christmas.
