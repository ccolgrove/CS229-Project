  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fight song was reputedly the creation of former owner Jerry Wolman's daughter, who, impressed by the &quot;war chant&quot; of the rival [[Washington Redskins]], implored her father to play an Eagle equivalent during Eagles games. With the eventual sale of the team and move to Veterans Stadium, the fight song was largely forgotten, although a few die-hards could be heard singing the lyrics on special occasions. That it was ultimately brought back to such popular acclaim is testament to the vision of Jeffrey Lurie, whose regime reinstated the practice of playing the song over stadium loudspeakers (with a modern addition of projecting the lyrics on the scoreboard) after Eagle touchdowns. The song is now ubiquitous wherever Eagle fans are found. The song has been heard at [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], and [[Philadelphia 76ers]] games, and even at the Philadelphia [[Live 8]] concert prior to the show.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
