  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The USPS is the third-largest employer in the United States (after the [[United States Department of Defense]] and [[Wal-Mart]]) and operates the largest civilian vehicle fleet in the world, with an estimated 260,000 vehicles, the majority of which are the easily identified [[Grumman LLV]] &quot;mail truck&quot;, as shown in the pictures below.  In an interview on NPR[http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3], a USPS official stated that for every penny increase in the national average price of [[gasoline]], the USPS spends an extra $8,000,000 to fuel their fleet.  This implies that the fleet requires some 800,000,000 gallons of fuel per year, and an estimated fuel budget of $2,000,000,000 were the national gasoline price to average $2.50.  Some [[mail carrier]]s use personal vehicles. Standard postal service vehicles do not have [[license plates]]; instead, a truck is identified by blue numbers on its back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
