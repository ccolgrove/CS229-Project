  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Antidisestablishmentarianism''' originated in the context of the [[nineteenth century]] [[Church of England]], where &quot;antidisestablishmentarians&quot; were opposed to proposals to remove the Church's status as the [[State religion|state church]] of [[England]]. The movement succeeded in England, but failed in [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]], with the [[Church of Ireland]] being disestablished in [[1871]] and the [[Church in Wales]] in [[1920]].  Antidisestablishmentarian members of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)#Unions and relationships with other Presbyterians|Free Church of Scotland]] delayed merger with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in a dispute about the position of the [[Church of Scotland]]. The term has largely fallen into disuse, although the issue itself is still current (see [[Act of Settlement 1701]]).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The word ''antidisestablishmentarianism'', with 28 letters, is the longest accepted word in the [[English language]]. There are other words, however, that are longer. For example: [[Supercalifragalisticexpialadocious]] is a nonsense word meaning fantastic. However, since it was taken from [[Mary Poppins]], a fantasy novel for children, it is as yet considered to be a real &quot;word.&quot; The claim that &quot;antidisestablishmentarianism&quot; is the longest word in the English language is actually quite arguable, since ''antidisestablishmentarianism'' is used seriously in academic and ecclesiastical writing about the Church of England when the concept arises, which it does occasionally (See e.g. Hastings and &quot;Some notes on the Church of England and Establishment&quot;, below). However, since [[1992]] it has lost this title to [[floccinaucinihilipilification]] in the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

If one loosens the definition of establishment to include a dominant force in a situation. An example of this in a modern sense may be the Israel (being modern antidisestablishmentarianists), the United States of America (the 'establishment') and terrorists (disestablishmentarianists). In other words, three parties, the first of which is in a position of power compared to the other two, the second who shares a common foe, the third party, with the first.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
