  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger remains a controversial figure. While she is widely credited as a leader of the modern birth control movement, and remains an iconic figure for the American [[reproductive rights]] movements, she also is reviled by some who condemn her as &quot;an abortion advocate&quot; (perhaps unfairly so: [[abortion]] was illegal during Sanger's lifetime and Planned Parenthood did not then support the procedure or lobby for its legalisation) or those who disagree in principle with Eugenics. Groups opposed to Planned Parenthood and/or legalized abortion have frequently targeted Sanger for her views, attributing her efforts to promote birth control to a desire to &quot;purify&quot; the human race through eugenics, and even to eliminate minority races by placing birth control clinics in minority neighborhoods.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Citizen Magazine.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For this reason, Sanger is often quoted selectively or out of context by detractors (a practice known as [[quote mining]]), and her history and involvement with socialism and eugenics have often been rationalized or even ignored by her defenders and biographers (a practice known as [[Spin (public relations)|spin doctoring]]). Despite the allegations of racism, Sanger's work with minorities earned the respect of civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Planned Parenthood Federation of America.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In their biographical article about Margaret Sanger, [[Planned Parenthood]] notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services. Staffed by a black physician and black social worker, the clinic was endorsed by The Amsterdam News (the powerful local newspaper), the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the [[Urban League]], and the black community's elder statesman, [[W.E.B. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;DuBois]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Planned Parenthood Federation of America.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although Sanger's views on abortion (like many of her opinions) changed throughout the course of her life, in her early years she was acutely aware of the problem of abortion, typically self-induced or with the aid of a [[midwife]]. Her opposition to abortion stemmed primarily from a concern for the dangers to the mother, and less so from legal concerns or the welfare of the unborn child. She wrote in a 1916 edition of ''Family Limitation,'' &quot;no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable,&quot; though she framed this in the context of her birth control advocacy, adding that &quot;abortions will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception. (Care is) the only cure for abortions.&quot; Sanger consistently regarded birth control and abortion as the responsibility and burden first and foremost of women, and as matters of law, medicine and public policy second.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gray.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
