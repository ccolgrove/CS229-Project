The WFM miners had sought to extend the benefits of union to the mill workers who processed their ore. Since the government had crushed the ARU, the railroad workers were again organized along craft lines under the AFL. Those same railroad unions continued to haul the ore ''from mines'' that were run by strike breakers, ''to mills'' that were run by strike breakers. &quot;The railroaders form the connecting link in the proposition that is scabby at both ends,&quot; Haywood complained. &quot;This fight, which is entering its third year, could have been won in three weeks if it were not for the fact that the trade unions are  lending assistance to the mine &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;operators.&quot;&amp;lt;Ref&amp;gt;Carlson, 80.&amp;lt;/Ref&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;The obvious solution, it seemed to Haywood, was for all of the workers to join the same union, and to take collective action in concert against the employers.
