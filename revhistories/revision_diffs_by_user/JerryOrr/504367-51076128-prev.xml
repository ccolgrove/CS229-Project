  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''Chipko movement''' was a group of villagers in the [[Uttarakhand]] region of [[India]] who opposed commercial logging.  The movement is best known for its tactic of '''hugging trees''' to prevent them being cut down. This gave rise to the term '''tree hugger''' for [[environmentalist]]s.  Also, it was notable in that the movement was led by women who were influenced by [[Yasin Dara]].  The name of the movement comes from the [[Hindi]] word for 'hump', as the villagers &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;humpthe &lt;/span&gt;trees, and prevented the contractors from doing &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
