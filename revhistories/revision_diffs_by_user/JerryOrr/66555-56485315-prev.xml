  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PRC's air force]] is considered large and powerful, although it is not yet capable of controlling Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict.  The ROC's airforce relies on Taiwan's second generation fighters. The ROC has approximately 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]], approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defence Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct BVR (Beyond Visual Range) combat missions with respective BVR missiles, while only a handful of PRC fighter airplanes are able to conduct such tasks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[2003]], the ROC made a purchase of four missile destroyersâthe former [[USS Kidd (DDG-993)|USS ''Kidd'']] and three sister ships, and expressed a strong interest in the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' class]].  But with the growth of the PRC [[People's Liberation Army Navy|navy]] and [[PLAAF|air force]], some doubt that the ROC could withstand a determined invasion from mainland China in the future. This also leads to a view that Taiwanese independence, if it is to be implemented, should be attempted as early as possible while the ROC still had the capacity for an all-out military conflict. Over the last three decades, estimates of how long Taiwan can withstand a full scale invasion from across the Strait without any outside help have [http://www.spacewar.com/2004/040811075029.onla5r7o.html] decreased from three months to only six days. Given such estimates, the US Navy has continued in practicising &quot;surging&quot; its carrier groups, giving it the experience necessary to respond quickly due to an attack on Taiwan.[http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/200477.asp] The US frequently collects data on the PRC's military movements, such as through the use of [[spy satellite|spy &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;satellites]]. &lt;/span&gt;As it would take days, even weeks, for China to prepare for a full assault on Taiwan, the US may have enough notice to prepare a relief force to protect the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;island. &lt;/span&gt;It would also allow the Taiwanese defence forces to prepare to resist an invasion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
