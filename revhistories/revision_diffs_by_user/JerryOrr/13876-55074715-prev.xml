  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Increasing pressure from the [[Philistines]] and other neighboring tribes forced the [[Israelites]] to unite under one king. The notion of kingship was for a long time anathemetised, as it was seen as one man being put in a position of reverence and power that in their faith was reserved for the one true [[God]]. According to the Bible, it was [[Samuel]], one of last of the judges, to whom the nation appealed for a king. Although he tried to disuade them, they were resolute and Samuel anointed [[Saul the King|Saul ben Kish]] from the tribe of [[Benjamin]] as the first king of the Israelites in approximately [[1020s BCE|1020 BCE]]. It was his successor, [[David]] c.[[1000s BCE|1006 BCE]], who was responsible for consolidating the monarchy and creating the first Hebrew state.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
