  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PRC's air force]] is considered large and powerful, although it is not yet capable of controlling Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict.  The ROC's airforce relies on Taiwan's second generation fighters. The ROC has approximately 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]], approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defence Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct BVR (Beyond Visual Range) combat missions with respective BVR missiles, while only a handful of PRC fighter airplanes are able to conduct such tasks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[2003]], the ROC made a purchase of four missile destroyersâthe former [[USS Kidd (DDG-993)|USS ''Kidd'']] and three sister ships, and expressed a strong interest in the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' class]].  But with the growth of the PRC [[People's Liberation Army Navy|navy]] and [[PLAAF|air force]], some doubt that the ROC could withstand a determined invasion from mainland China in the future. This also leads to a view that Taiwanese independence, if it is to be implemented, should be attempted as early as possible while the ROC still had the capacity for an all-out military conflict. Over the last three decades, estimates of how long Taiwan can withstand a full scale invasion from across the Strait without any outside help have [http://www.spacewar.com/2004/040811075029.onla5r7o.html] decreased from three months to only six days. Given such estimates, the US Navy has continued in practicising &quot;surging&quot; its carrier groups, giving it the experience necessary to respond quickly due to an attack on Taiwan. The US frequently collects data on the PRC's military movements, such as through the use of [[spy satellite|spy satellites]]. As it would take days, even weeks, for China to prepare for a full assault on Taiwan, it is believed that the US would have enough notice to prepare a relief force to protect the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;island. &lt;/span&gt;It would also allow the Taiwanese defence forces to prepare to resist an invasion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Naturally, the possible war is not being planned in a vacuum.  In [[1979]], the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]], a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and the Pescadores, but not to Quemoy and Matsu).  The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The [[Seventh Fleet]], operating primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']]. Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it is safely assumed from past actions that that is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
