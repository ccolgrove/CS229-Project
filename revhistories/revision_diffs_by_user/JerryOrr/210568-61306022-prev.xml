  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Central to Hill was that on [[January 10]], [[1914]], John G. Morrison and his son Arling were killed in their [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] butcher store by two armed intruders masked in red bandanas. Arling had drawn a shotgun from behind the counter and wounded one of the masked men before being killed.  The police first thought it was a crime of revenge, for nothing had been stolen.  On the same evening, Joe Hill appeared on the doorsteps of a local doctor with a bullet wound.  Hill said that he had been wounded defending a woman. The doctor noticed that Hill was armed with a [[pistol]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hill was arrested for Morrison's death. Morrison had once been a police officer, and several men he had arrested were at first considered suspects, but they were not pursued. A red bandana was found in Hill's rooms. The pistol, purported to be in Hill's possession at the doctor's office, was not found. Hill resolutely denied that he was involved in the robbery and killing of Morrison, but he refused to testify at his trial, and was convicted of murder. An appeal to the Utah Supreme Court was unsuccessful, and it is uncertain whether appeals for mercy organized by the [[I.W.W.]] did his case any good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Much later the state of Utah declared that under their law today, Joe Hill would not have been executed based on the evidence presented at his trial. Hill was executed by [[firing squad]] on [[November 19]], [[1915]]. Just prior to his execution, he had written to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Haywood]], &lt;/span&gt;an I.W.W. leader, saying &quot;Don't waste any time in mourning.
