  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Unification supporters in Mainland China argue that the ROC and PRC are two different factions in the Chinese Civil War, which never legally ended. Therefore both factions belong to the same sovereign countryâChina. Since Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to China, the secession of Taiwan should be agreed upon by 1.3 billion Chinese citizens instead of the 23 million residents who currently live on Taiwan. Furthermore, given the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which states &quot;Recognizing that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations&quot;, the PRC is formally granted the sovereignty of all of China, including Taiwan. Therefore, based on the PRC's sovereignty claim on Taiwan, it is well within the legal rights of the People's Republic of China to extend its jurisdiction to Taiwan, by military means if necessary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The ROC counters that the pressure the PRC exerts prevents the ROC from being widely recognized and that Article 3 of the same Montevideo Convention specifically says, &quot;The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by other states.&quot; This was accomplished because the PRC took many coercive steps to isolate the ROC diplomatically. Nevertheless, the Unification supporters point out the fact that the [[Montevideo Convention]] was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the [[United Nations]] as well as UN Resolutions should supersede the [[Montevideo Convention]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The current position of the [[People's Republic of China]] is that &quot;the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China&quot;.  The PRC is unwilling to negotiate with the ROC under any other formulation than a [[One-China policy|one China policy]], but has been willing to allow the meaning of &quot;one China&quot; to remain ambiguous. The PRC government considers perceived violations of its One-China Policy, or inconsistencies such as supplying the ROC with arms, a violation of its rights to [[territorial integrity]]. International news organizations often report that &quot;China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be united with the mainland by force if necessary&quot;, even though the PRC does not explicitly say that Taiwan is a renegade province. However official PRC media outlets and officials often refer to Taiwan as &quot;China's [[Taiwan Province]]&quot;. (The PRC claims [[Quemoy]], [[Wuchiu]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] as part of its [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], and the South China Sea Islands part of its [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]] provinces.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
