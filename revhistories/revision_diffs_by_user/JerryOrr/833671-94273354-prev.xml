And on June 5 of the next year, the University bestowed an Honorary Doctor of Science to Dr. Barnes.  In 2002, The Barnes Foundation contested Albert C.

A settlement was brokered by [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Pensylvania Governor]] [[Edward Rendell]] in 2005. Since that the time, the collective has evolved into a three-campus model, with a new facility in Center City, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Philadelphia - allowing the Foundation to better fulfill Dr. Barnes' vision of art, democracy, and education for the common man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
