  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the long-term, the battle raised awareness of the appalling conditions faced by miners in the dangerous West Virginia coalfields, and led directly to a change in union tactics into political battles to get the law on labor's side vice confrontations with recalcitrant and abusive managements and thence to the much larger organized labor victory a few years later during the [[New Deal]] in [[1933]]. That in turn led to the UMWA helping organize many better-known unions such as the Steel workers and Teamster's during the mid-thirties.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
