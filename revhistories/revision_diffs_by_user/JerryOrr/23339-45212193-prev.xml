  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* During a 1999 game against the division rival [[Dallas Cowboys]], Cowboys wide receiver (and ''bete noire'' of Eagle fans) [[Michael Irvin]] was knocked unconscious when his head was driven into Philadelphia's hard turf-covered cement field after a catch. As Irvin lay prostrate and immobile on the turf, Eagles fans cheered the injury. Irvin was ultimately diagnosed with a broken neck, and the injury ended his career.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* During a 1989 game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], following a snowstorm, the city failed to clear the stadium. Fans threw snowballs, iceballs and more onto the field, pelting players, officials, coaches and one another. Future Pennsylvania Governor [[Edward Rendell]] got caught up in the fallout from that game when he admitted to a reporter that he had bet another fan $20 that the fan couldn't reach the field with a snowball. As a result, the team added security and banned beer sales for their last remaining home game of the regular season. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;*  During a 2004 home game against the Dallas Cowboys, fans told a man in a wheelchair to take off his Cowboys jersey. When he refused, disgruntled fans pushed him down a flight of stairs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Acts of violence by Eagles fans against fans of visiting teams, combined with ongoing difficulties relating to public drunkenness, prompted Philadelphia municipal judge [[Seamus McCaffrey]] and the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] to establish a small, in-stadium courtroom at the Vet in 1997. Additionally, plainclothes officers, dressed in the colors of the visiting team, dispatched to sit in sections known as being dangerous to opposing fans, most such sections being located in the Vet's notorious &quot;700 Level&quot; at the top of the stadium. The success of the program was widely noted and has continued to the present day (Lincoln Financial Field includes a built-in prison facility and courtroom for such purposes). Eagle fans caught by such sting operations are arrested, charged and taken to the courtroom, where McCaffrey usually sits in judgment. Such efforts have made the inside of the stadium much safer for opposing fans than was previously the case.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
