  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* A contingent of Eagles fans traveled to the [[1999]] [[NFL Draft]] in New York for the sole purpose of jeering the Eagles selecting anyone other than [[Heisman Trophy]] winning running back [[Ricky Williams]].  Local radio hosts had recruited the boorishly behaving crew to protest the selection, which turned out to be future Pro-Bowl quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]].  McNabb stayed composed during the incident, and the thirty or so fans who booed him were subsequently derided as the &quot;Dirty Thirty,&quot; while the radio hosts in question were widely criticized for their roles as instigators.  McNabb has since become one of Philadelphia's most beloved sports icons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

As Irvin lay prostrate and immobile on the turf, Eagles fans cheered the injury. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;When a trainers' cart was sent on the field to carry Irvin off the field seemingly possibly paralyzed, the roar of the fans increased.  &lt;/span&gt;Irvin was ultimately diagnosed with a broken neck, and the injury ended his career.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Acts of violence by Eagles fans against fans of visiting teams, combined with ongoing difficulties relating to public drunkenness, prompted Philadelphia municipal judge [[Seamus McCaffrey]] and the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] to establish a small, in-stadium courtroom at the Vet in [[1997]].  Additionally, plainclothes officers, dressed in the colors of the visiting team, were dispatched to sit in sections known as being dangerous to opposing fans, most such sections being located in the Vet's notorious &quot;700 Level&quot; at the top of the stadium.  The success of the program was widely noted and has continued to the present day (Lincoln Financial Field includes a built-in prison facility and courtroom for such purposes).  Eagle fans caught by such sting operations are arrested, charged and taken to the courtroom, where McCaffrey usually sits in judgment.  Such efforts have made the inside of the stadium much safer for opposing fans than was previously the case, but the stadium parking lots (and subways to the games) are still notoriously anarchic places.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
