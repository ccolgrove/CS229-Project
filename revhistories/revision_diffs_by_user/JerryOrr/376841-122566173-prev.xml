  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Due to a lack of cooperation and often the active aggressive moves on the part of the Soviets and several other factors, the Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal: to free part of the Polish territories so that a government loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] could be established there instead of a Soviet [[puppet state]]. There is no consensus among historians as to whether that was ever possible, or whether those operations had any other lasting effect. Some argue that without Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising, Poland would have ended as a Soviet republic, a fate definitely worse than that of an &quot;independent&quot; puppet state, and thus the Operation succeeded at least partially in being a political demonstration to the Soviets and Western &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Allies. It is also worth mentioning that due to &lt;/span&gt;the Warsaw &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Uprising, &lt;/span&gt;the Soviets stopped their offensive in Poland to let the Germans suppress the uprising. Some historians speculate that if they had not stopped their march, they would have occupied all of Germany rather than just the eastern section. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The city of Warsaw was rebuilt, with the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] being restored to its former state. However, complete recovery as a major European capital only began in the early 1990s after the fall of [[communism]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
