  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in [[1911]], in which more than 100 garment workers were burned alive or died jumping from the ninth floor of a factory building, dramatized the conditions that Schneiderman, the WTUL and the union movement were fighting. The WTUL had documented similar unsafe conditions &amp;amp;mdash; factories without fire escapes or that had locked the exit doors to keep workers from stealing materials &amp;amp;mdash; at dozens of sweatshops in New York City and surrounding communities; twenty-five workers had died in a similar sweatshop fire in [[Newark, New Jersey]] shortly before the Triangle disaster. Schneiderman expressed her anger at the memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911 to an audience largely made up of the well-heeled members of the WTUL:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
