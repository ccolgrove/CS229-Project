  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger was born in [[Corning, New York|Corning]], [[New York]]. Her mother was a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] who went through 18 pregnancies (with 11 live births)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Steinem.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; before dying of [[tuberculosis]]. After &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;dropping out of &lt;/span&gt;[[Claverack College]] in [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]], Sanger &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;served &lt;/span&gt;as a [[nurse]] and worked for ten years in the affluent New York suburb of [[White Plains]]. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Her profession as a nurse, however, was not a medical profession, and related only to basic house-keeping functions for the sick.) &lt;/span&gt;In 1902, she married William Sanger. Although stricken by tuberculosis, she gave birth to a son the following year, followed in subsequent years by a second son and a daughter who died in childhood.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

It was raided by the police and Sanger was arrested for violating the post office's obscenity laws by sending birth control information by mail. Sanger fled to [[Europe]] to escape prosecution. There, she had an affair with the famous science-fiction author, [[H.

The ''Birth Control Review'' regularly published eugenicist articles such as &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy&quot;, by the Fascist author Lothrop Stoddard, along with Margaretâs own article, &quot;Plan for Peace&quot;, which promoted coercive sterilization of the unfit, mandatory segregation, and camps for the unfit that she called &quot;dysgenic stocks.&quot;  ''The Review'' also published a eugenicist article by Margaretâs [[Nazi]] friend and confident, [[Ernst RÃ¼din]], who was then [[Adolph Hitler]]âs director of genetic sterilization and was later invited by Sanger to serve as an advisor for [[Planned Parenthood]]. She also contributed articles on health for the [[United States Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] paper, ''The Call''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

It was followed in 1917 by ''What Every Mother Should Know''. That year, Sanger was sent to the workhouse for &quot;creating a [[public nuisance]].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
