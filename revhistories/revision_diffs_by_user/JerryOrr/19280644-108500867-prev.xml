His grandsons, Johannes and Jacobus, began the [[Oyster Bay, New York|Oyster Bay]] and [[Hyde Park, New York]] branches of the Roosevelt family. Eleanor was descended from the Johannes branch while her future husband, Franklin was descended from the Jacobus branch. They were fifth cousins once removed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
