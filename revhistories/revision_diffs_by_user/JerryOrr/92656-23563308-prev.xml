  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has ruled, on a [[reference question]] ([[Re: Same-Sex Marriage]], 2004) that the government has the authority to amend the definition of marriage, but did not rule on whether or not such a change is required by the equality provisions of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The Court stated that such a ruling is not necessary because the federal government had accepted the rulings of lower courts. The Court also ruled that religious institutions could not be required to perform same-sex marriages. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
