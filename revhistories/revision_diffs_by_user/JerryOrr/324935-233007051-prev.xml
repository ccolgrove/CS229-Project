  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Despite the efforts of his supporters, Haywood was unable to overturn the conviction. In 1921, Haywood skipped bail while out on appeal and fled to [[Russia]].  In Russia, Haywood became an advisor to Lenin's [[Bolshevik]] government,&amp;lt;ref name=linder /&amp;gt;  but Lenin's illness and death and Stalin's rise to power ended his role as an advisor to the Soviet labor movement.  At the invitation of CPUSA member [[Gus Hall]], Idaho newspaper reporter [[John B.
