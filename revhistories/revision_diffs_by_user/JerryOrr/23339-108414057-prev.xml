  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;When discussing the history of the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Philadelphia &lt;/span&gt;Eagles one must realize it is a history of futility and failure. Every season ends in disappointment. Although this is to be expected from a bunch of losers their ineptness is history making. This is a team that was so terrible that a bartender earned a spot as a walk on and these idiots made a movie about it. They once were so broke they merged with another team and became the Steagles along with the Pittsbugh Steelers...imagine the shame!!! Once Losers...Always Losers!!!! That is the Eagles war cry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Midway through the 1931 season, Philadelphia's representative in the NFL, the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]], went bankrupt and ceased operations. After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL awarded the dormant franchise to a syndicate headed by former Yellow Jackets owners [[Bert Bell]] and [[Lud Wray]], in exchange for an entry fee of $2,500. Drawing inspiration from the insignia of the centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], the [[National Recovery Act]], Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. (Neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy; furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster. Some observers, however, believe the two teams should be treated as one.) The Eagles, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the defunct [[Cincinnati Reds (NFL)|Cincinnati Reds]], joined the NFL as [[expansion team]]s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
