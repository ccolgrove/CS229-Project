  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Haywood was frequently the target of prosecution. His trial for the murder of [[Frank Steunenberg]] in 1907 (of which he was acquitted) drew national attention; in 1918, he was one of 101 IWW members convicted of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]. While out of prison during an appeal of his conviction, Haywood fled to [[Russia]], where he would spend the remaining years of his life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
