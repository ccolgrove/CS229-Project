  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;: &quot;Most English-speaking people...will admit that ''cellar door'' is 'beautiful', especially if dissociated from its sense (and from its spelling). More beautiful than, say, ''sky'', and far more beautiful than ''beautiful''. Well then, in Welsh for me ''cellar doors'' are extraordinarily frequent, and moving to the higher dimension, the words in which there is pleasure in the contemplation of the association of form and sense are abundant.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tolkien's discourse is the most likely origin of this concept and the only documented one.  Nonetheless, this phrase has been subject to a legendary degree of misattribution.  In common circulation, this pronouncement is commonly attributed to &quot;a famous &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;linguist&quot;.  (It may be noted that J. &lt;/span&gt;R. R. Tolkien, while more commonly noted as an author, was also a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;linguist.)  &lt;/span&gt;It has also been mistakenly attributed to [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Dorothy &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Parker]], and [[Robert Frost]] although no such texts have surfaced. (Dorothy &lt;/span&gt;Parker is also quoted as saying that the most beautiful words in the language are &quot;cheque &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;enclosed.&quot;)  &lt;/span&gt;The most detailed account alludes to a [[statistical survey|survey]], possibly conducted around the [[1940s]], probing the word in the English language generally thought to be the most beautiful.  Contributing to this survey, [[United States|American]] writer [[H. L. Mencken]] supposedly claimed that a [[China|Chinese]] student, who knew little or no English, especially liked the phrase ''cellar door'' &amp;amp;mdash; not for what it meant, but rather for how it sounded.  Some accounts describe the immigrant as [[Italy|Italian]] rather than Chinese.  Another account suggests that it is a mispronunciation of the [[French language|French]] words ''C'est de l'or'', which can be translated as &quot;It is gold&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
