  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;''White Guards'' had been organized throughout the year of 1917, and in December numbered nearly 40,000. In response, the organization of ''Red Guards,'' was stepped up in November, and numbered at the end of the year nearly 30,000. After [[Finland's declaration of independence]], the parliament empowered the [[Senate of Finland|Senate]] on [[January 12]], [[1918]], to create a &quot;strong police authority&quot;. Soon it became obvious that it was intended to legalise the White Guards in this way, excluding the ''Red Guards'' and others that sympathized with the Social Democrats, who now constituted the opposition in parliament, with almost 50% of the votes and seats. On [[January 25]], the Senate decreed the ''White Guards'' to be troops of Finland's government, and the point of no return was passed. Many leading Social Democrats joined in when the war broke out independently in three different towns, but formally the rebellion was not supported by the executive organs of the party.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
