  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;From the time that Haywood first became an official with the Western Federation of Miners, he was convinced that the system under which working people toiled was unjust. But he also became very skeptical of the role played by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), believing that key officials from that organization were out of touch with real workers. Haywood identified with the philosophy of the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket]] martyrs, and critized labor officials who were, in his view, insufficiently supportive. For example, Haywood recalled with disdain the opening remarks of [[Samuel Gompers]] when he appeared before Illinois Governor &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Oglesby &lt;/span&gt;on behalf of those men:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
