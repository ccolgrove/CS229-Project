While she is widely credited as a leader of the modern birth control movement, and remains an iconic figure for the American [[reproductive rights]] movements, she also is reviled by some who condemn her as &quot;an abortion advocate&quot; (perhaps unfairly so: [[abortion]] was illegal during Sanger's lifetime and Planned Parenthood did not then support the procedure or lobby for its legalisation) or those who disagree in principle with Eugenics. Groups opposed to Planned Parenthood and/or legalized abortion have frequently targeted Sanger for her views, attributing her efforts to promote birth control to a desire to &quot;purify&quot; the human race through eugenics, and even to eliminate minority races by placing birth control clinics in minority neighborhoods.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Marshall.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For this reason, Sanger is often quoted selectively or out of context by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;detractors, &lt;/span&gt;and her history and involvement with socialism and eugenics have often been rationalized or even ignored by her defenders and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;biographers. &lt;/span&gt;Despite the allegations of racism, Sanger's work with minorities earned the respect of civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Planned Parenthood Federation of America.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In their biographical article about Margaret Sanger, [[Planned Parenthood]] notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
