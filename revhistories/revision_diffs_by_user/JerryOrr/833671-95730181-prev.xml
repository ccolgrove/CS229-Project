  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1950, Albert C. Barnes, a local scientist and entrepreneur, amended the by-laws of his art collective, the [[Barnes Foundation]], to enable the Board of Trustees of Lincoln University to nominate four of the five Trustees upon the demise of all the original Trustees - giving Lincoln primary responsibilty for one of the largest private art collections in the world.  And on June 5 of the next year, the University bestowed an Honorary Doctor of Science to Dr. Barnes.  In 2002, The Barnes Foundation contested Albert C. Barnes' [[will]], arguing that the Merion location of the collective and the small number of Board members limited the Foundation's ability to sustain itself financially.  A settlement was brokered by [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Pensylvania Governor]] [[Edward Rendell]] in 2005. Since that the time, the collective has evolved into a three-campus model, with a new facility in Center City, Philadelphia.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
