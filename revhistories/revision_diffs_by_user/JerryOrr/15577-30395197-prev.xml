  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After a turbulent year in office in which he saw his approval ratings plummet to the single digits, Prime Minister Mori agreed to hold early elections for the LDP presidency in order to improve his party's chances in crucial July [[2001]] Upper House elections. On [[April 24]], [[2001]], riding a wave of grassroots desire for change, maverick politician [[Junichiro Koizumi]] defeated former Prime Minister Hashimoto and other party stalwarts on a platform of economic and political reform. Koizumi was elected as Japan's 87th Prime Minister on [[April 26]], [[2001]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
