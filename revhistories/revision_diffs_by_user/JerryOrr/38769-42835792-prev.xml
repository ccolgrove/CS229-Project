  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[852]], [[Burgred]] came to the throne and with [[Ethelwulf of Wessex]] subjugated north [[Wales]]. In [[868]], [[Denmark|Danish]] armies occupied [[Nottingham]]. The Danes drove Burgred, the last king of Mercia from his kingdom in [[874]]. In [[886]], the eastern part of the kingdom became part of the [[Danelaw]], while Mercia was reduced to its western portion only. The Danes appointed a Mercian thegn, [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf II]], as king in [[873]] while the remaining independent section of Mercia was ruled by [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Aethelred]], called an ealderman, not a king. He ruled from [[883]] until [[911]], in a close and trusting alliance with [[Wessex]]. Aethelred had married [[Ethelfleda]], daughter of [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex. She gradually assumed power as her husband sickened after about [[900]], possibly as a result of his wounds gained at the decisive battle against the Vikings at [[Tettenhall]] where the last large Viking army to ravage England suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the combined Mercian and Wessex army. After Aethelred's death she ruled alone until her death in [[918]] when her brother, [[Edward the Elder]] of Wessex became king.  Ethelfleda freely gave London and Oxford to her brother in Wessex as a token of loyalty, and concentrated on fortifying Mercia's existing borders - east towards Nottingham, north to Chester, along the Welsh marches, and down to the Severn estuary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

This hidage exists in several manuscript versions, some as late as the [[14th century]]; it lists a number of peoples who have vanished, except for reminders in various placenames.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
