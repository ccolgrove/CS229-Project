  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Eugenics''' is a social philosophy which advocates the improvement of [[human]] [[hereditary]] traits through social intervention. The goals have variously been to create healthier, more [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] people, save society [[economics|resources]], and lessen human [[suffering]]. Proposed means of achieving these goals most commonly include [[prenatal testing]] and screening, [[genetic counseling]], [[birth control]], [[selective &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;breeding]],cock &lt;/span&gt;[[In vitro fertilisation]], and [[genetic engineering]]. Critics argue that eugenics is a [[pseudoscience]].  Historically, eugenics has been used as a justification for coercive state-sponsored [[discrimination]], and severe human rights violations, such as [[forced sterilization]] and even [[genocide]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Selective breeding of human beings was suggested at least as far back as [[Plato]], but the modern field was first formulated by [[Francis Galton|Sir Francis Galton]] in 1865, drawing on the recent work of his cousin, [[Charles Darwin]]. From its inception, eugenics (derived from the Greek &quot;well born&quot; or &quot;good breeding&quot;) was supported by prominent thinkers (including [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[W.E.B. DuBois]]) and was an academic discipline at many colleges and universities. Its scientific reputation tumbled in the 1930s, a time when [[Ernst RÃ¼din]] began incorporating eugenic rhetoric into the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. During the postwar period both the public and the scientific community largely associated eugenics with [[Nazism|Nazi]] abuses, which included enforced &quot;[[racial hygiene]]&quot; and [[extermination]], although a variety of regional and national governments maintained eugenic programs until the 1970s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
