  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services. Staffed by a black physician and black social worker, the clinic was endorsed by The Amsterdam News (the powerful local newspaper), the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the [[Urban League]], and the black community's elder statesman, [[W.E.B. DuBois]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Knowles.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the same time, Sanger was accused of genocide against the black population through racially biased sterilization and abortions.  On December 10th, 1939, Sanger wrote Birth Control Federation of America director Dr. Clarence Gamble a letter reading, &quot;We do not want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population.&quot;  This was in response to Gamble's November 1939 memorandum titled a &quot;Suggestion for Negro Project&quot; (http://www.blackgenocide.org/sanger02.html).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although Sanger's views on abortion (like many of her opinions) changed throughout the course of her life, in her early years she was acutely aware of the problem of abortion, typically self-induced or with the aid of a [[midwife]]. Her opposition to abortion stemmed primarily from a concern for the dangers to the mother, and less so from legal concerns or the welfare of the unborn child. She wrote in a 1916 edition of ''Family Limitation,'' &quot;no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable,&quot; though she framed this in the context of her birth control advocacy, adding that &quot;abortions will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception. (Care is) the only cure for abortions.&quot; Sanger consistently regarded birth control and abortion as the responsibility and burden first and foremost of women, and as matters of law, medicine and public policy second.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gray.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
