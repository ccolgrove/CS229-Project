  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zinn was brought up in a [[blue-collar]] [[Jewish]] immigrant family in [[Brooklyn]]. Born in Austria, his father, Eddie Zinn, emigrated to the U.S. before the outbreak of World War I with his mother, Jenny Zinn, and brother Phil. Jenny Zinn grew up in the Eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk where she met her future husband, Eddie, a soldier stationed there.{{fn|4}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a young adult, Howard Zinn was a shipyard worker and labor organizer in the Brooklyn shipyards; later, he flew bombing missions in Europe during [[World War II]], an experience that shaped his opposition to war. Zinn was a [[B-17]] &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[bombardier (Army Air Force)|bombardier]] &lt;/span&gt;with the 490th Bomb Group, and in April, [[1945]] he participated in the [[napalm]] bombing of [[Royan]], [[France]], which was occupied by German troops. Nine years later, Zinn visited Royan, to examine documents and interview residents. He wrote an account of the bombing of Royan, which was published in his book ''The Politics of History'' and is also included in ''The Zinn Reader.''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zinn questions the immense number of civilian casualties that resulted from the United States bombing cities such as Dresden, Royan, Tokyo, and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, Hanoi during the U.S. war in Vietnam, and Baghdad during the U.S. war in Iraq. He makes the case against targeting civilians in his pamphlet Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence [http://cps-www.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html]. Instead of bombing civilians, he contends that the Axis powers could have been opposed during World War II through popularly organized acts of [[nonviolent resistance]]. He writes: &quot;The term '[[just war]]' contains an internal contradiction. War is inherently unjust, and the great challenge of our time is how to deal with evil, tyranny, and oppression without killing huge numbers of people.&quot;{{fn|2}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
