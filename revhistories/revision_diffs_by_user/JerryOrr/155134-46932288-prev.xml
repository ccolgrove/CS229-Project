  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In many countries, wildcat strikes do not enjoy the same legal protections as standard union strikes, and may result in penalties for the union members who participate or their union.  The same often applies in the case of strikes conducted without an official ballot of the union membership, as is required in some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A strike may consist of workers refusing to attend work or [[picketing]] outside the workplace so as to prevent or dissuade other people from working in their place or conducting business with their employer. Less frequently workers may occupy the workplace, but refuse either to do their jobs or to leave.  This is known as a [[sit-down strike]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

An employer may not fire, but may permanently replace, workers who engage in a strike over economic issues. On the other hand, employers charged with committing unfair labor practices (ULPs) may not replace employees who strike over ULPs, and must fire any strikebreakers they have hired as replacements in order to reinstate the striking workers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Strikes may be specific to a particular workplace, employer, or unit within a workplace, or they may encompass an entire industry, or every worker within a city or country.  Strikes that involve all workers, or a number of large and important groups of workers, in a particular community or region are known as [[general strike]]s. Under some circumstances, strikes may take place in order to put pressure on the State or other authorities or may be a response to unsafe conditions in the workplace.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
