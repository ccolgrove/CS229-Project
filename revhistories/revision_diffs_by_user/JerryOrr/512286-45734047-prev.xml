  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the design and the first construction stage, a heated debate ensued about the high cost of the project (the last estimate was $8.25 billion). An especially recurrent argument was the contrast with [[NASA]]'s contribution to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), which was of similar amount. Critics of the project argued that the US could not afford both of them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The project was eventually canceled by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in [[1993]] due to heavy pressure from President Bill Clinton.  Many questioned the wisdom of closing down the facility, which had brought high-paying science jobs to the southern regions of the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex.  As predicted, the closing of the SSC held drastic ramifications for the area, and resulted in a mild recession made most evident in those parts of [[Dallas]] which lay south of the [[Trinity River]]. It is thought today that President Clinton had wanted to close the SSC all along as an economic retaliation against George H. W. Bush's home state of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Texas]]. &lt;/span&gt;22.5 km (14 mi) of tunnel were already dug and nearly 2 billion dollars had already been spent on the massive facility.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
