  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the time Pocahontas was a child, her father was the leader of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] and the English colonists had just arrived and were establishing settlements. Pocahontas is said to have stopped her father from executing colonialist [[John Smith of Jamestown]] in December 1607 at [[Werowocomoco]], the chief village of her father near Jamestown. The truth of this story cannot be verified; Pocahontas was only thirteen years old at the time and could not have known Smith for long, as he had arrived from [[England]] that year. Smith did not speak the Powhatan language at that time, and may have misunderstood what was actually happening. Some reports indicate that this could have been a popular Powhatan ritual &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(http://www.apva.org/history/pocahont.html).  &lt;/span&gt;Smith's account was the sole source, and was long considered to be a fabrication, in part because he never mentioned the event in any of the sundry monographs about the colony that he published in the twenty years following his return. Some recent researchers &amp;lt;!---Who?---&amp;gt;assert that there is little reason to doubt his veracity, but the more romanticized popular versions of the story are unlikely to be accurate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whatever really happened, a friendly relationship with Smith and the rest of the colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] was initiated, and Pocahontas would often come to the settlement and play with the children there. During hard times, Pocahontas also helped to save the Jamestown colony from [[extinction]] by supplying it with food. However, as the colonists expanded further, some of the Native Americans felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts occurred. An injury from a gunpowder explosion forced Smith to return to England in 1609. After his departure, relations with the Powhatans deteriorated significantly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
