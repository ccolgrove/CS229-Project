  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;All &lt;/span&gt;of the children's accusations were bizarre. Some alleged that, in addition to having been sexually abused, they saw witches fly, traveled in a hot-air balloon, and were taken in one case through secret underground tunnels, which were sought by investigators but never found. Ray Buckey was described as having beaten a giraffe to death with a baseball bat in front of the children. When shown a series of photographs by police, one child identified actor [[Chuck Norris]] as one of the abusers.  There were claims of orgies at car washes and airports, and of children being flushed down toilets to secret rooms where they would be abused, then cleaned up and presented back to their unsuspecting parents. Some children said they were made to play a game called &quot;Naked Movie Star&quot; in which they were photographed nude. Despite a multi-million dollar world wide search in conjunction with [[Interpol]], no child pornography was ever recovered during the investigation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
