  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sanger founded the [[American Birth Control League]] (ABCL) in 1921 with [[Lothrop Stoddard]] and [[C. C. Little]]. In 1922, she traveled to [[Japan]] to work with Japanese feminist [[Kato Shidzue]] promoting birth control; over the next several years, she would return another six times for this purpose. In this year, she also married oil tycoon James Noah H. Slee. In 1923, under the auspices of the ABCL, she established the Clinical Research Bureau. It was the first legal birth control clinic in the U.S. (renamed Margaret Sanger Research Bureau in her honor in 1940). That year, she also formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control and served as its president of until its dissolution in 1937 after birth control under medical supervision was legalized in many states. In 1927, Sanger helped organize the first [[World Population Conference]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

From 1939 to 1942, she was an honorary delegate of the Birth Control Federation of America. From 1952 to 1959, she served as president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation; at the time, the largest private international family planning organization.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
