He also said that he would demand that Egyptian authorities pursue &quot;outlaws&quot; and &quot;investigate those who caused the security disarray.&quot; Mubarak said that peaceful protests were transformed into &quot;unfortunate clashes, mobilised and controlled by political forces that wanted to escalate and worsen the situation&quot;. He called upon the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]] to change the term limits of the presidency and to change the requirements to run for president. He also accepted the legal charges against parliament members which meant a great amount of the parliament members would be changed through the legal process.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE7102JP20110201?pageNumber=1&amp;amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;amp;sp=true |title=Text â President Mubarak's Speech after Mass Protest |work=[[Reuters]] |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
