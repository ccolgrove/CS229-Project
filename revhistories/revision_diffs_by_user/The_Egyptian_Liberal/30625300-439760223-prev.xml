  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beginning July 8th revolutionaries in Tahrir square have begun another sit-in which stands to this day.  Initially because of the fact that the army would not fire on the citizens in the first uprising that started in January, slogans were chanted that the people and the Army are one.  However, now that Egypt is under rule of the Army and there has been no good progress for true liberty and equality for Egyptians, the Egyptian revolutionary people have decided that the Army ruler has lost his legitimacy.  One protester pointed out that the people gave legitimacy to the Army when they decided to leave Tahrir square.  But since the Army also seems to be corrupt and is not following the people's demands there is now another ongoing protest and sit-in in Tahrir square that promises to practice escalating civil disobedience.  This is now the &quot;Law of Protest&quot; in Egypt which is the true ruling party of Egypt, not the so-called military.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
