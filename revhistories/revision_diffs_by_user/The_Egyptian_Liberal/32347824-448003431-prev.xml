Mubarak awarded Salem licenses to work on both projects. Salem's relations with Israeli business circles dates back to the 1970s during his tenure at the Washington D.C. embassy and whilst the Israelis and Egyptians were negotiating Camp David. In 1996, Salem sold most of his shares in the new refinery company, Midor, and made a substantial profit. In 2007, he sold most of his shares in the [[East Mediterranean Gas Company]], a year before the pipeline actually pumped any gas. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Israel gained 40% of its gas needs from below-market price Egyptian gas exports. The Israeli newspaper [[Yediot Aharonoth]] described Salem as the &quot;number one man&quot; of the normalization process between the two states.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia5&quot;&amp;gt;Yehia, Karem.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Following the overthrow of Mubarak during the 2011 revolution, Salem was indicted for corruption charges related to the gas deal. A main witness of the prosecution, accused Salem of illegally making $2 billion from the gas deals since he owned 70% of the shares in the East Mediterranean Gas Company during its inception. The Egyptian-Israeli contract itself is blamed for inflicting an annual Egyptian loss of $714 million due to the fixed, below international market price which Israel is supposed to pay. Salem is currently being held in Spain, awaiting possible extradition, and is being tried ''in absentia'' as Defendant No. 7 in an Egyptian court.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia5&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
