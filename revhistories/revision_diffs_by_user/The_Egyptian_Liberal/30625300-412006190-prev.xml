  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After his previous decision of preventing former ministers and government officials from traveling and freezing bank accounts, The Prosecutor General decided to prevent former minister of Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid, from traveling outside the country and the freezing of accounts in banks. Rashid on a phone call with Alarabiya stated that &quot;I returned from Davos to Egypt because of the current situation in Egypt. The new Prime Minister had contacted me for the same position in the new cabinet, I refused because I want fresh blood.&quot;. Regarding the prevention decision he commented &quot;I had no idea about the accusations, I served for six and half years and I am completely ready to face any accusation. No one had informed me of this decision and I heard it from the news&quot;/ It worth mentioning that Rashid enjoys a good reputation among Egyptian people. Rashid was a possible candidate for Prime Minister position before the events. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
