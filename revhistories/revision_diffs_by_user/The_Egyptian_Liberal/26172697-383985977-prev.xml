The board of a club can decide to give the manager a contract extension or not; this will depend on certain objectives being met, or if they feel that the user have potential as a manager. The manager reputation rating is still in the game and will go up or down depending on your efforts. Regular emails will appear from the coach telling the user about player growth, and if a player is gaining or losing overall rating, the coach will also tell the user about players that are hitting form and will suggest the user include them in the starting line up for the next match, or give them a little more responsibility. On the player growth screen, the user will also get comments from the coach, such as âHas reached his potential,&quot; &quot;Isnât going to grow anymore,â or âCould develop quickly if given game time.&quot; A new budget allocator has also been implemented, where the player can adjust the slider to whatever they desire, whether it will be a 80/20 split with Â£50 million to spend and Â£200K wage budget, or a 60/40 split, where that may be Â£40 million to spend and Â£250K wage budget. This gives some flexibility if the user is trying to buy specific players but doesn't have the wages to cover it, or doesn't need the wages and wants more free cash. There is a limit, however; when doing this, the user will get the notification that this is only available three times, so the player must make their decisions wisely.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://fifa.easports.com/enGB/news.action?id=DiggingDeeperCareerMode&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
