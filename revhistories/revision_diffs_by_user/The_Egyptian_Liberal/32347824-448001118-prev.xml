That same year, 1963, Howeidi was appointed ambassador to [[Iraq]] and he brought Salem with him to serve as the Arab Company's branch director in [[Baghdad]]. Salem began cultivating relationships with the high-ranking staff of the Egyptian embassy in Iraq, particularly Amin Yousri the embassy's press-attache and Ibrahim Yousri the embassy's second secretary.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to Ibrahim Yousri, Salem gained Howeidi's trust primarily because he was able to regularly provide Howeidi with useful intelligence due to his connections with business circles in Iraq which would have otherwise been difficult to attain through the Egyptian embassy. Amin Yousri claims Salem cultivated good relationships with other Egyptian embassy employees by helping them buy Mercedes vehicles at low interest rates offered by the [[Iraqi Central Bank]]. Despite his relative success in Baghdad, Salem did not find his work there as particularly fulfilling and requested Howeidi a number of times for transfer to Europe where he said he had &quot;friends&quot; who could help him start a private business. Instead, Salem was sent on ambassadorial missions to the Arab Gulf states. There he succeeded in establishing his own personal networks that would later become useful during his future business ventures in those states.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia2&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Relations between Howeidi and Salem deteriorated following Nasser's death in 1970 and the succession of [[Anwar Sadat]] to the presidency afterward. Howeidi, an ardent supporter and symbol of Nasser's [[Arab socialism|socialist]] and [[Arab nationalist|nationalist]] struggles, was imprisoned by Sadat in 1971; Salem, uninterested in Nasser's ideals subsequently abandoned Howeidi, did not visit him in prison and ignored his wife's phone calls. Nonetheless, Salem lost his job in the Intelligence Directorate along with its perks. His half-brother Abdel Hamid later managed to secure Salem a job at Nasr Import and Export Company that same year by petitioning a senior official in Sadat's administration.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia2&quot;/&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
