At first tensions were high between the police and protesters with violence breaking out in [[Suez]] and [[Alexandria]]. The government took a hard line, using riot-control tactics, and shutting down communications. But by the 28th the protests were continuing and the police had retreated. The security role was taken over by the military, and from then on the situation remained almost entirely peaceful. As pressure rose on Mubarak, the scale of the protests continued to grow, especially on specially organized Friday rallies. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
