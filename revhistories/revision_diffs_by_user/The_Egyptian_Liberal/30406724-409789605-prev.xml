  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''2011 Algerian protests''' are a continuing series of street demonstrations taking place throughout [[Algeria]] from January 2011 onwards. The demonstrations and riots were reported to have started over [[unemployment]], the lack of housing, [[food inflation]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[freedom of speech]] and poor [[living conditions]]. While localised protests were already commonplace over previous years, simultaneous protests and riots erupted all over the country starting in January 2011.  These were quelled by government measures to lower food prices, but were followed by a wave of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;self-immolations, &lt;/span&gt;most of them in front of government buildings.  Opposition parties then began to hold demonstrations, illegal in Algeria without government permission under the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;State &lt;/span&gt;of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Emergency &lt;/span&gt;obtaining since 1992.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
