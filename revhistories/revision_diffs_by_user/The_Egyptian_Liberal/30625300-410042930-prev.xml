Some 17,000 people are detained under the law, and estimates of [[political prisoner]]s run as high as 30,000. Under that &quot;state of emergency&quot;, the government has the right to imprison individuals for any period of time, and for virtually no reason, thus keeping them in prisons without trials for any period.  The government continues the claim that opposition groups like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] could come into power in Egypt if the current government did not forgo parliamentary elections, confiscate the group's main financiers' possessions, and detain group figureheads, actions which are virtually impossible without emergency law and judicial-system independence prevention. However, critics  argue that this goes against the principles of [[democracy]], which include a [[citizen]]'s [[right to a fair trial]] and their [[Suffrage|right to vote]] for whichever candidate and/or party they deem fit to run their &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
