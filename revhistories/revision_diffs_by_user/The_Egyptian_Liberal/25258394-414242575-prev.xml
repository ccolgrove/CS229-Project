  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The failure to achieve the 5% threshold by the major opposition parties, whether independently or collectively, has endangered their involvement in the upcoming Presidential Elections in 2011. The amendment of article 76 of the Constitution, which allowed multi-candidate presidential elections, but imposed draconian rules on party nominees, is thought to be in need of alteration to remove the 5% restriction. Without such an alteration, the 2011 presidential elections will be little more than a modified version of the single-candidate poll it has been for the past 5 decades or so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

There were also rumours that the President Mubarak's son had fled the country.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
