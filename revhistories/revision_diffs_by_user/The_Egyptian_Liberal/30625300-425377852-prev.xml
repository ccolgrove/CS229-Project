The uprising was mainly comprised of a campaign of non-violent [[civil resistance]], which featured a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], marches, acts of [[civil disobedience]], and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of [[socio-economic]] and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of [[Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Despite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters. The uprising took place in [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], and in other cities in Egypt, following the [[Tunisian Revolution]] that saw the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Mubarak resigned from office.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
