In addition, by late 2009, EMG had signed contracts to supply through the pipeline additional 2&amp;amp;nbsp;bcm per year to private electricity generators and various industrial concerns in Israel and negotiations with other potential buyers were ongoing. In 2010, the pipeline is supplying approximately half of the natural gas consumed in Israel, with the other half being supplied from domestic resources. The total physical capacity of the pipeline is 9&amp;amp;nbsp;bcm per year and agreements between the two nations provide a framework for the purchase of up to 7.5&amp;amp;nbsp;bcm per year of Egyptian gas by Israeli entities, making Israel one of Egypt's most important natural gas export markets.In 2010 some Egyptian activists got Legal provision in force against governemental authorities to stop gas flow to Israel according to the obscure contract and very low price compared to the universal rates , however provision was denied by Mubarak regime for unknown reason.in 2011 after 25 January Revolution against Mubarak regime , many of the Egyptians called for stopping gas project with Israel due to low price and Israeli violence against Palestinian people. Moreover, pipeline was bombed twice and obligated to be stopped for repair , in addition , &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Hussein Salem &lt;/span&gt;&quot;Egyptian businessman involved in this project&quot; is wanted by the interpol for several crimes in Egypt.The most important issue in this project that is gaining more hate daily among Egyptians.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
