  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On August 4, Mohamed Mohsen, a protester and an activist, died at Nasser Hospital Institute, 12 days after he was hit with a rock that caused him brain hemorrhage. Mohsen had participated in a march on July 23 heading to the Ministry of Defense in denouncement of SCAF, which was stopped at the neighborhood of Abbasseya by military troops. Thereafter, the entire march was attacked by thugs, and allegedly by the residents of Abbasseya as well, who threw rocks and molotov cocktails at the protesters. One eyewitness said Mohsen was hit by a rock from a nearby rooftop, which made it likely that he was indeed hit by a resident of the area. Protesters were unable to have him hospitalized for over two hours, as ambulances couldn't reach the march, which was surrounded by military police, and he was not taken to the nearby Demerdash Hospital because of rumors that injured protesters were being arrested. After several other hospitals refused to take him in he was eventually admitted at the Nasser Hospital. The lag between his injury and hospitalization as well as apparently very poor health care eventually led to Mohsen's &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;death.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.shorouknews.com/contentdata.aspx?id=518916 Ululations in farewell to the Abbasseya martyr]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;Protesters blamed SCAF for his death, as it was believed the attacks against the march came at the incitement and fear-mongering of the military, and specifically put the blame on Major General Hassan el-Ruweiny. A large funeral was held for him in his home city of [[Aswan]], and around 200 protesters held a funeral at a mosque near [[Tahrir Square]], after [[Friday Prayer]]s. It was blocked from entering the square by military police and [[Central Security &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Forces]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/483566 Protesters show solidarity with victim of Abbasseya attack]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dostor.org/politics/egypt/11/august/5/50278 Military Police block a march to Tahrir Square]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/483640 Army and Police close Tahrir Square to Protesters for the first time after the Revolution]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;Later during the day, protesters had a Ramadan [[iftar]] in the square in a celebratory manner, but soon afterwards were attacked and dispersed by military police after claiming they were planning on renewing the sit-in in &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Tahrir.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/483685 Army forces disperse the &quot;Tahrir Iftar&quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
