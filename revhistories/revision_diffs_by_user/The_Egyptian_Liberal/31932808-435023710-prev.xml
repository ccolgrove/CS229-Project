As a pacifist, he declared his conscientious objection, and demanded to be exempted from military service. He was arrested on 12 November 2010 by military police but was released two days later, and finally exempted from military service on medical grounds. Sanad participated actively in the Egyptian revolution, and especially highlighted the fact that Egypt has effectively been ruled by the military for six decades. He was arrested on 4 February by military police and tortured, but released 27 hours later. He was arrested in his home in the Ain Shams neighbourhood in Cairo at about 10PM on 28 March 2011 by military police.

As a pacifist, he declared his conscientious objection, and demanded to be exempted from military service. He was arrested on 12 November 2010 by military police but was released two days later, and finally exempted from military service on medical grounds. Sanad participated actively in the Egyptian revolution, and especially highlighted the fact that Egypt has effectively been ruled by the military for six decades. He was arrested on 4 February by military police and tortured, but released 27 hours later. He was arrested in his home in the Ain Shams neighbourhood in Cairo at about 10PM on 28 March 2011 by military police.
