  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On 24 May 2011, Mubarak was ordered to stand trial on charges of [[premeditated murder]] of peaceful protestors during the 2011 Egyptian revolution and, if convicted, could face the [[death penalty]]. The decision to try Mubarak was made days before a scheduled protest in Tahir Square. The full list of charges released by the public prosecutor was &quot;intentional murder, attempted killing of some demonstrators...misuse of influence and deliberately wasting public funds and unlawfully making private financial gains and profits.&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;reutersmurdercharges&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The charges are corruption and the premediated killing of peaceful protestors during the mass movement to oust him, the latter of which carries the death penalty.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/201161131532286483.html Mubarak and sons to stand trial in August] Al Jazeera.

Upon reading out the charges to him, Mubarak pleaded not guilty, denying responsibility for the charges against him.
