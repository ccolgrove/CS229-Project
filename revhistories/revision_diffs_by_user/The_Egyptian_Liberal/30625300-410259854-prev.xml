Shenker was beaten several times along with numerous other protesters, after which they were loaded onto one of the security trucks. Shenker was crowded with 43 others in the vehicle, whose only ventilation were thick metal grates. They were driven for hours, and one of the protesters, who was diabetic, fell into a coma. Others futilely tried to get the truck driver to stop. After stopping near a government security headquarters far outside the city, a policeman unlocked the vehicle door, wanting a specific prisoner, Ayman Nour's son.
