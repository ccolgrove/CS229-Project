  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers rights were being addressed in the political dialogue.  He said, &quot;Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles -- such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties -- are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates.&quot;  He told [[Al-Ahram]], &quot;Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/740/eg10.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;amp;#124; Egypt &amp;amp;#124; May Day and the absent actor |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=2005-05-04 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the [[Esco]] workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform &quot;essential duties&quot;, was broad enough to permit random firings.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/743/eg42.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;amp;#124; Egypt &amp;amp;#124; 'A partial victory' |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).  He said, &quot;Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions.  They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straight jacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;power.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/734/eg9.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company.  He said, &quot;The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/749/eg9.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;amp;#124; Egypt &amp;amp;#124; Political spin-off effects |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=2005-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
