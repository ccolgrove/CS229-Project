  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''28 January 2011''': The '''&quot;Friday of Anger&quot;''' protests began. Hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Cairo (which also saw the arrival of opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei) and other Egyptian cities after Friday Prayers. There were reports of looting, and prisons were opened and burned down on orders from then-Minister of the Interior Habib El Adly, causing prison inmates to escape en-masse, in what was believed to an attempt to terrorize protesters. The prison breaks were coupled with the complete withdrawal of police forces from the streets. The military was ordered to deploy to assist the police. International fears of violence grew, but no major casualties were reported. President Hosni Mubarak made his first address to the nation, after 4 days of ongoing protests and pledged to form a new government. Later that night clashes broke out in Tahrir Square between Revolutionaries and Pro-Mubarak Thugs, leading to the injury of several, and the death of Karim Ahmed Ragab&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
