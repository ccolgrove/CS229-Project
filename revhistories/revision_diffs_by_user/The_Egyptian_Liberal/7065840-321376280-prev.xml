  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Ali Abdel Raziq''' (1888-1966) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Islamic studies|Islamic scholar]] and [[sharia]] judge. He can be regarded as the intellectual father of Islamic laicism or secularism (the [[separation of church and state|separation of state and religion]], not the [[secularization]] of society). His main work is called &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;&quot;Islam &lt;/span&gt;and the Foundations of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Governance&quot; &lt;/span&gt;(''Al-Islam Wa Usul Al-Hukm'') and was first published in 1925. Due to its controversial standpoints regarding the necessity of the [[caliphate]] and religious government, the book triggered an intellectual and political battle in [[Egypt]]. In essence the author claims that the Muslims may agree on any kind of government, be it religious or worldly, as long as it serves the interest and common welfare of their society. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
