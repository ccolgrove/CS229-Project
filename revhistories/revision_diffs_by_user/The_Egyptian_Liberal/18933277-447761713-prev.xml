They allowed the protestors to continue a festival type event at the Pearl Roundabout where different groups came and shared their views. The [[Crown Prince|Salman Bin Hamad Al-Khalifa]] promised a dialogue during this period.  Within this time, [[Robert Gates]], Defense Secretary of the United States, visited Bahrain to discuss the situation along with a visit to the [[UAE]] on an arms deal. Historically, the 2nd line of defense against a Shia uprising has been to call the Saudi National Guard ever since the British army left in 1971.  Due to the media attention on the protests, the idea to use the [[Saudi Arabian]] troops along with other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] member states under the operating name of the [[Peninsula Shield]] was a plan. It was decided that if the protests could be moved to a financial district, based on the guidelines of the formation of this military body, it would be able to move legally into the country, even though it was the first time it was used internally against GCC citizens.  Kuwait declined taking part on this ground operation based on this &quot;misuse&quot; of the organization, though it sent naval help later on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
