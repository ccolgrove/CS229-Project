Security forces were sent to rallies to deal with what the Interior Ministry called &quot;illegal acts which resulted from demonstrations,&quot; the state news agency reported. An opposition group called The February 14 Coalition said it planned to launch protests on Friday and Saturday in the newly named Martyr's Square, the site formerly known as [[Pearl Roundabout]]. &quot;Just like all other freedom-loving people living in real democracies across the globe, we, the people of Bahrain have the right to choose the way in which we are governed,&quot; the group said. The Youth Coalition of February 14 announced it would be holding a sit-in demonstration at the same location.&amp;lt;ref name =&quot;CNN23.9&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
