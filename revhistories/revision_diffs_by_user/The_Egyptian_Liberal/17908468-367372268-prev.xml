  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The story begins with Russell, played by Jim Carrey, on his deathbed recalling the events of his life that led him there. He begins with his life in Texas as a happily married police officer who plays the organ at church, has sex every night with his wife ([[Leslie Mann]]) and spends his off hours searching for his biological mother who gave him up as a child. But after a violent car crash, Russell leaves his life and family behind to go out into the world and be his true self which he believes to be a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;gay &lt;/span&gt;man. He moves to Miami, finds a boyfriend ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and begins living a promiscuous gay lifestyle. He realizes quickly though, that a life of luxury is expensive, leading this resourceful former cop to turn to a life as a conman. But when his con work finally catches up with him, Russell is sent to prison where he meets, and almost instantly falls in love with &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor). &lt;/span&gt;From there it becomes a story of a forlorn lover who cannot bear to be separated from his soul-mate. He will go to any lengths to be with Phillip, including but not limited to walking out of jail pretending to be a doctor, after stealing a badge and painting his clothing, ordering his release pretending to  be a judge, impersonating Morris's lawyer and fraudulently becoming the [[CFO]] of a major corporation. He also simulates suffering from [[AIDS]], and forges records to indicate that he died from it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
