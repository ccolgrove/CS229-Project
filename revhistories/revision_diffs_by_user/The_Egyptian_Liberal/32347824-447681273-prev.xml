  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Relations between Howeidi and Salem deteriorated following Nasser's death in 1970 and the succession of [[Anwar Sadat]] to the presidency afterward. Howeidi, an ardent supporter and symbol of Nasser's [[Arab socialism|socialist]] and [[Arab nationalist|nationalist]] struggles, was imprisoned by Sadat in 1971; Salem, uninterested in Nasser's ideals subsequently abandoned Howeidi, did not visit him in prison and ignored his wife's phone calls. Nonetheless, Salem lost his job in the Intelligence Directorate along with its perks. His half-brother Abdel Hamid later managed to secure Salem a job at Nasr Import and Export Company that same year by petitioning a senior official in Sadat's administration.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia2&quot;/&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unhappy at the loss of the prestige and perks of his former intelligence job, Salem decided to move to [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) in 1972 where he became CEO of the Arab Emirates Trade Company, an importer of food supplies for UAE. He was set up there by former Egyptian economy minister Hassan Abbas Zaki, an economic adviser to the president of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed, at the time. Using his position, between 1972 and 1977 Salem reportedly developed extensive business relations in several Western countries, as well as [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Through these contacts, he gained considerable wealth and began transferring large amounts of cash to [[Switzerland]] where he also purchased a number of hotels.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia2&quot;/&amp;gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Salem returned to Egypt following his business ventures in the UAE. In addition to his past history with the Egyptian government, he had established relations with highly influential figures in Egypt by appointing their sons or relatives to positions in his company in the UAE. In late 1977, not long after arriving in Egypt, he met [[Hosni Mubarak]] whom Sadat appointed Vice President in 1975. It was only in 1977 that things began to shape up for Salem. After returning to Egypt from a short assignment in the United Arab Emirates, he moved with his family from his Golf area apartment into a new unit in an apartment building he constructed in Saba Emarat area of Heliopolis. For two years Salem lived in his old apartment in [[Cairo]]'s affluent [[Heliopolis]] neighborhood. Although he was a millionaire by then, he took a job as an employee of the economy ministry, tasked with managing commercial deals. He reportedly kept his other business ventures private while working in the government. In 1979, Prime Minister [[Mustafa Khalil]] appointed him Commissioned Minster of Trade at the Egyptian embassy in [[Washington D.C.]].&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AhramYehia2&quot;/&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;That same year, Salem became CEO of the Egyptian American Transportation Company (ETSCO), established in [[Delaware]] with a branch in Cairo. On October 9, 1982, an article was published by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' entailing violations the company committed regarding various arms deals following the the singing of the [[Camp David Accords]] in 1979. The arms deals involved using money from the [[Persian Gulf states]] to fund [[Mujahideen]] efforts against the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]] and dictatorships in [[Latin America]]. Kamal Hassan Ali, the Egyptian minister of foreign affairs at the time, vehemently denied the allegations against ETSCO, calling them &quot;wicked.&quot; He claimed the Egyptian government found no evidence of foul play on the part of the company during its year-long investigation of the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;incident li &lt;/span&gt;went on to threaten to sue &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;âanyone &lt;/span&gt;who dares to smear his name or any other Egyptian &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;officialâ &lt;/span&gt;in American courts. The American network ABC ran a story in early March of 2011 about what it described as corruption that was built in the Camp David Accords and American military aid to Egypt. The network highlighted what it called the role of [[Hosni Mubarak]], Mounir Thabet ([[Suzanne Mubarak]]âs brother) and the late Field Marshal Abu-Ghazalah in ETSCOâs illegal ventures. These men made millions of dollars by running an operation riddled with commissions, bribes and bidding violations.  Salem paid an $8 million fine to [[The Pentagon]] in 1984 to settle the case. However, Ambassador Amin Yousri told us he personally discovered that Salem actually paid the Pentagon a much larger figure than was publicly announced.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Yehia, Karem.
