  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and &quot;pure&quot; agricultural work when done by women and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;minor.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/ec4.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;Abbas said: &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&quot;When you consider that a large proportion of working women are unskilled and work as domestic servants, then we are depriving a good number of working women from any protection. Quite an omission when you consider the recent case of actress Wafaa Mekki who brutally tortured her two servants. And how do you define &quot;pure&quot; agriculture? We all know that women and minors are used extensively in farming; why deprive them in particular from legal protection?...Over the past several years, a clear set of problems faced by workers has emerged. These workers, men and women, need to be protected from signing 'form six,' working over eight hours a day, secretive labour relations [in many cases workers are not allowed to keep a copy of their contract], the usurpation of the right to agreed wages and compensation in case of accident, lay-offs and/or closure. The proposed law solves none of these problems...Who constitute the bulk of the private sector working class? Young, unskilled people, in many cases of rural background. For example, the workers of the industrial satellite city of 10th of Ramadan come from the villages and small towns of Sharqiya governorate...While most have a diploma, or even higher degrees, they are given low-skilled jobs -- skills that can be learnt on the job, which means they are easy to replace. So neither their background nor the nature of their jobs makes it easy for them to resist unfair working conditions, no matter how harsh. On the other hand, the attitude of most businesses to labour is: 'These are my workers and I can do with them what I want'...Everyone is so pleased with having broken with the idea of 'job permanency'. But today, the problem faced by workers is that they can be turfed on to the street in a flash...It is true that, on paper, labour was represented. But the current trade union structure has only a symbolic presence among private sector workers. And since [trade union officials] are the representatives of a public sector on its way to oblivion, how relevant is their representation to today's working class?...The top echelons of the current trade union are not your typical trade union bureaucrats. Many of them are only a few months from retirement. All of them have been dissociated from their class for years. They have another agenda, another set of realities, to take into consideration; these are totally divorced from those of the class they allegedly represent...The fight should really be about the need for training and re-training the working class, finding solutions to unemployment, the role of both the Ministry of Labour and Immigration, as well as the trade union. Everyone keeps postponing [these questions] and focusing on the draft law. What is all the ado about? We all know that at the end of the day unless the fundamental issues are solved labour is in a bind -- new law or &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;not.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/ec4.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and &quot;pure&quot; agricultural work when done by women and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;minor.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2002&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/ec4.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;amp;#124; Economy &amp;amp;#124; Dirge for a dog? |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=2002-01-23 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;Abbas said: &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&quot;When you consider that a large proportion of working women are unskilled and work as domestic servants, then we are depriving a good number of working women from any protection. Quite an omission when you consider the recent case of actress Wafaa Mekki who brutally tortured her two servants. And how do you define &quot;pure&quot; agriculture? We all know that women and minors are used extensively in farming; why deprive them in particular from legal protection?...Over the past several years, a clear set of problems faced by workers has emerged. These workers, men and women, need to be protected from signing 'form six,' working over eight hours a day, secretive labour relations [in many cases workers are not allowed to keep a copy of their contract], the usurpation of the right to agreed wages and compensation in case of accident, lay-offs and/or closure. The proposed law solves none of these problems...Who constitute the bulk of the private sector working class? Young, unskilled people, in many cases of rural background. For example, the workers of the industrial satellite city of 10th of Ramadan come from the villages and small towns of Sharqiya governorate...While most have a diploma, or even higher degrees, they are given low-skilled jobs -- skills that can be learnt on the job, which means they are easy to replace. So neither their background nor the nature of their jobs makes it easy for them to resist unfair working conditions, no matter how harsh. On the other hand, the attitude of most businesses to labour is: 'These are my workers and I can do with them what I want'...Everyone is so pleased with having broken with the idea of 'job permanency'. But today, the problem faced by workers is that they can be turfed on to the street in a flash...It is true that, on paper, labour was represented. But the current trade union structure has only a symbolic presence among private sector workers. And since [trade union officials] are the representatives of a public sector on its way to oblivion, how relevant is their representation to today's working class?...The top echelons of the current trade union are not your typical trade union bureaucrats. Many of them are only a few months from retirement. All of them have been dissociated from their class for years. They have another agenda, another set of realities, to take into consideration; these are totally divorced from those of the class they allegedly represent...The fight should really be about the need for training and re-training the working class, finding solutions to unemployment, the role of both the Ministry of Labour and Immigration, as well as the trade union. Everyone keeps postponing [these questions] and focusing on the draft law. What is all the ado about? We all know that at the end of the day unless the fundamental issues are solved labour is in a bind -- new law or &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;not.&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2002&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002 which deals with NGO registration, security and public order.  Abbas was critical of the registration procedures:  &quot;The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control.  And there has been heavy government pressure.  But we decided to try and open negotiations with them.  After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen - things could get even worse tomorrow.&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&amp;gt;''Margins of Repression'' by Human Rights Watch&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words &quot;worker&quot; and &quot;trade union&quot; from the organization name or scope.  &quot;They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized.  They said the name breaches Article 11.  We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow.  There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
