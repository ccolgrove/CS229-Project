On jihad and the treatment of unbelievers, the difficult passages for modernists are the so-called &quot;verses of the sword,&quot; such as 9:5 on the Arab pagans and 9:29 on the people of the Book â Shepard, W E, op cit, 1987, p. 330&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In some cases modernist (re)interpretation can find support in the text, such as the requirement of four witnesses to adultery, which may have the effect of voiding the hadd in practice, or the permission of four wives conditioned on the ability of the husband to treat them fairly, which is argued as denied by another passage.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
