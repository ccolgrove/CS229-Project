On January 28, 2011 the police force withdrew from the street of Egypt. A number of prisons were broken into and prisoners were allowed to leave. Some prisons were allegedly opened by prison guards. On February 2, 2011, in what was latterly called the &quot;Battle of the Camel&quot; thugs stormed [[Tahrir square]] in downtown Cairo, where the demonstrators were stationed, and attacked them with Molotov cocktail, rocks, chipped marble, swords and other weapons from horse, donkey and camel backs.
