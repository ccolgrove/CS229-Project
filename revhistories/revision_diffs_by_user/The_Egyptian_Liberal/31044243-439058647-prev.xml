As the Muslim Brotherhoodâs stage was the highest and largest, many protesters complained that they were attempting to gain an unfair advantage over the other political parties. These accusations were in addition to the Muslim Brotherhood's opposition to a sit-in called by other political groups to pressure the Supreme Council of Armed Forces into meeting their demands. Though the Muslim Brotherhood decided to join the protests only two days before the event, it said that it would avoid the sit-in and leave by 17:00. The event was used to rally support for the various groups by organizing their own tents and passing out paraphernalia.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;englishahram&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/15899/Egypt/Politics-/Hundreds-of-thousands-revitalise-Egypts-revolution.aspx |title=Hundreds of thousands revitalise Egypt's revolution on Determination Friday â Politics â Egypt â Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
