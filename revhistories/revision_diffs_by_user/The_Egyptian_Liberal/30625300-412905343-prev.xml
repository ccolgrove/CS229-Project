  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zahi Hawass, Egypt's minister of antiquities, announced that artifacts damaged by looters would be restored over the next five days&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;aljazlive&quot;/&amp;gt;. He also said that steps were being taken to reopen Egypt's famed archaeological sites, which have been closed since pro-democracy protests started two weeks ago&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;aljazlive&quot;/&amp;gt;. Among the objects damaged was a statue of King Tutankhamun standing on a panther and a wooden sarcophagus from the New Kingdom period, dating back roughly 3,500 years ago&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;aljazlive&quot;/&amp;gt;. On January 28, looters broke into the museum and damaged a number of items, including two mummified skulls from the Late Period&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;aljazlive&quot;/&amp;gt;. The museum, which is right next to the massive anti-government protests in downtown Cairo, is now being guarded by the army&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;aljazlive&quot;/&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
