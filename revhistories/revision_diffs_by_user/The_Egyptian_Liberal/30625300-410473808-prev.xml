  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the first day of protests the Egyptian government censored most of the media outlets inside Egypt and took measures to block social media websites&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://mashable.com/2011/01/26/facebook-blocked-in-egypt/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; that have helped the protesters spread the news about the events on the ground. The success of the protests have been largely attributed to the involvement of tech savvy youth all over Egypt who were able to overcome the government blockades on social media. On the 27th of January, it was reported on Twitter by many Egyptian and foreign reporters on the ground that the government has blocked text messaging and [[Blackberry]] messaging services.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/27/blackberry-internet-service-reportedly-blocked-in-egypt/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Shortly afterwards, it was reported that all cellphone services were to be suspended on Friday in anticipation of the fourth day of protests, which is expected to be the largest in the country's recent history.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
