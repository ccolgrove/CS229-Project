  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On 14 January 2011, protests took place in Jordan's capital Amman, Maan, Karak, Salt and Irbid and other cities. The protests, led by trade unionists and [[leftist]] parties, came after [[Friday prayers]], and called for the government led by Prime Minister [[Samir Rifai]] to step down. They chanted anti-government slogans and called Rifai a &quot;coward.&quot; One banner in the protest read &quot;Jordan is not only for the rich. Bread is a red line. Beware of our starvation and fury,&quot; while protesters chanted &quot;Down with Rifai's government. Unify yourselves because the government wants to eat your flesh. Raise fuel prices to fill your pocket with millions.&quot; Tawfiq al-Batoush, a former head of the Karak municipality, said: &quot;We are protesting the policies of the government, high prices and repeated taxation that made the Jordanian people revolt.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/20111141219337111.html |title=Jordanians march against inflation â Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Muslim Brotherhood#Jordan|Muslim Brotherhood]] and 14 trade unions said they would hold a sit-down protest outside parliament the next day to &quot;denounce government['s] economic policies.&quot; Parallels were drawn with the Tunisian protests.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/15/jordanians-protest-over-food-prices|title=Jordanians protest against soaring food prices|author=Johnny McDevitt}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
