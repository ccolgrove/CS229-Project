  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The above points taken together demonstrate that the Mu`tazilites were not in any dominant position during the Mihna, nor was their ideology the state's official creed. The Mihna was al-Mamun's attempt to assert his theological and legal authority over the juristic culture, especially the defiant traditionists and traditionalists.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is important to note that in classical Islam, it was private individuals and not the caliphate who undertook the mission of developing the various Islamic sciences including the law. That is, the law, contrary to what happens in modern nation states, was not the exclusive preserve of the state. In fact, the [[Ulema|jurists]] developed it in conscious opposition to the state (e.g., Jackson, 2002). From early on, there was a religious order in classical Islam that was distinct from the political order. The semi-autonomy of the scholars resulted in the interesting phenomenon of the emergence of different, and regarding some issues, diametrically opposed [[Madh'hab|schools of jurisprudence]] â all considered Islamically valid and authentic. The Mihna, within this context, reflects the caliph's frustration with the powerful and influential juristic culture. It lasted about fifteen years, after which the domains of authority of both the political and religious orders became more well-defined. This does not mean that confrontation was the hallmark of the relationship between both orders. The relationship was more nuanced and involved not only confrontation but also collaboration. Generally speaking, the religious order stood as a buffer between the political order and the common people. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
