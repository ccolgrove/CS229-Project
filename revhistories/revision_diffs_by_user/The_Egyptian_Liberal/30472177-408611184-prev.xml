Because of this city authorities regularly confiscated Bouaziziâs small wheelbarrow of fruit. But Bouazizi had few options to try to make a living, and he bought his merchandise by getting into debt. He had contracted approximately $200 USD in debt to buy his merchandise.

Failing this, Bouazizi then bought two bottles of paint thinner and set himself alight in front of the building. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/922279--suicide-protest-helped-topple-tunisian-regime Suicide protest helped topple Tunisian regime]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
