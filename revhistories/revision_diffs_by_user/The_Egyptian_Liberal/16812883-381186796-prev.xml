  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was suggested that secular oriented women do not support [[sharia]] as the main source of legislation, rather they refer to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and the resolution of [[human rights]] conventions, as adopted by the [[United Nations]], as frames for reference for their struggle. Azza Karam (1998:13), for example, describes secular feminists as follows: &quot;Secular feminists firmly believe in grounding their discourse outside the realm of any religion, whether Muslim or Christian, and placing it, instead within the international human rights discourse. They do not âwaste their timeâ attempting to harmonize religious discourses with the concept and declarations pertinent to human rights. To them religion is respected as a private matter for each individual, but it is totally rejected as a basis from which to formulate any agenda on womenâs emancipation. By so doing, they avoid being caught up in interminable debates on the position of women with religion.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nadje Al-Ali, ''Secularism Gender and the State'',p140&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;However variations exist concerning the interpretation and manifestation of secularism in womenâs politics and lifestyles many of them are united in their opposition to the establishment of an Islamic state (for example that is compulsory to wear veiling) and they share the sense that religion should not be mixed with politics.â Siham K., a member of Rabat Al-Marâa Al`arabiyya (the Alliance for Arab Women) p141 said: &quot;I am one of the people who believe that Islam has to be separated from civil, political and economic rights and duties. It is an option that Egypt is a Muslim country. This should remain personal. The freedom of belief is integral. It should not interfere with womenâs rights. It cannot be part of the view of politics and the future. This is another story altogether. I want religion to be detached away from actual politics.&quot; &amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Generally, secular women activists call for total equality between the sexes, attempt to ground their ideas on womenâs rights outside religious frameworks, perceive Islamism as an obstacle to their equality and a linkage to patriarchal values. (Karam, 1998: 2345).And they argue that secularism was important for protecting civil rights.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Zainab Al-Sawaij, who serves as the executive director of the American Islamic Congress and is a human rights activist&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/jb_religion.htm: March 2, 2006 Conflicting Ideas of Secularism Cloud âIdealâ of Secular Democracy in Middle East&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
