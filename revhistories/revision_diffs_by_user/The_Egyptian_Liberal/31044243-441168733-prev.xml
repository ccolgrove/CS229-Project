  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sharaf also accepted the resignation of Finance Minister Samir Radwan (the reason for his resignation was due to the fact that his new budget was deemed by many protestors to be too conservative in dealing with the poverty which had been one of the main catalysts of the uprising) and the foreign minister, who was replaced by the former ambassador to Saudia Arabia, Mohammed Kamel Omar.
