  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Slave women were required mainly as concubines and menials. A Muslim slaveholder was entitled by law to the sexual enjoyment of his slave women. While free women might own male slaves, they had no such right.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lewis 1990, page 14.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated1&amp;gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, page 13.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The property of a slave was owned by his or her master unless a contract of freedom of the slave had been entered into, which allowed the slave to earn money to purchase his or her freedom and similarly to pay bride wealth. The marriage of slaves required the consent of the owner. Under the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence male slaves could marry two wives, but the Maliki permitted them to marry four wives like the free men. According to the Islamic law, a male slave could marry a free woman but this was discouraged in practice.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Sikainga&quot;/&amp;gt; Islam permits sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage.
