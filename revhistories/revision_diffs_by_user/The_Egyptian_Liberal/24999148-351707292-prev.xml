  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;ElBaradei did not make any clear statements regarding his intentions to run for the office, however he has demanded that certain conditions have to be met to ensure fair elections accompanied by changes to the constitution that will allow more freedom for independent candidates before he would actually consider running for presidency. Several opposition groups and parties have endorsed him, considering him a neutral figure who could transition the country to greater [[democracy]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On 24th February 2010, ElBaradei met with several opposition leaders and notable intellects at his home in [[Cairo]]. The meeting was concluded with an announcement for the formation of a new non-party-political movement called &quot;[[National Association for Change]]&quot;. The movement aims for general reforms in the political scene and mainly burke the Constitutional article#76 which places restrictions on true free presidential elections especially when it comes to independent candidates. Worth mentioning is that the banned political group the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] were represented by one of their key figures who attended the meeting however their stand in accepting a non-member of their group as a candidate is yet unclear. It is also unknown whether [[Amr Moussa]] the head of the [[Arab League]] who met with Elbaradei a day earlier will be part of the new &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;movement.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8534365.stm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
