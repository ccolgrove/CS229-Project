  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Minister of Antiquities Zahi Hawass announced that artifacts damaged by looters would be restored over the next five days. He also said that steps were being taken to reopen Egypt's famed archaeological sites, which have been closed since pro-democracy protests started two weeks ago. Among the objects damaged was a statue of King Tutankhamun standing on a panther and a wooden sarcophagus from the New Kingdom period, dating back roughly 3,500 years ago. The museum, which is right next to the massive anti-government protests in downtown Cairo, is now being guarded by the army.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;aljazbloglive7feb&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
