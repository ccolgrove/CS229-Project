However, he has underlined a condition for him to run for the elections, this condition is a &quot;written assurance&quot; about the integrity and freedom of the electoral process from the Egyptian Government. ElBaradei said in a television interview conducted with [[CNN News]], &quot;I will study the possibility of running for presidential candidate in Egypt if there  any written guarantees that the electoral process will be free and fair.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
