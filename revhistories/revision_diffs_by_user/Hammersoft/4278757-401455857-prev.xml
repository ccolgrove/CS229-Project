The following year, he opened the first bar in Valencia designed by Mariscal, together with [[Fernando Salas]], the Duplex, for which he designed one of his most famous pieces, the Duplex stool, an authentic icon of the 1980s. In 1981, his work as a furniture designer led him to participate in the exhibition Memphis, an International Style, in Milan. In 1987, he gave an exhibition at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris and participated in the [[Documenta de Kassel]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In 1989, [[Cobi]] was chosen as the mascot for the [[Barcelona 1992]] [[Olympic Games]]. The mascot was the centre of great controversy because of its vanguard image, although time has shown its creator to have been right and now [[Cobi]] is recognised as the most profitable mascot in the history of the modern games. He later created the cartoon series The Cobi Troupe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
