  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After months waiting for news, Alan accepted Shelly was dead, only for her to come to the memorial service. Although he was horrified that Shelly had let Steph go to prison for suspected murder, he forgave her and they tried rebuilding their relationship. Shelly couldnât live with Steph around, however, and Alan was unable to disown his daughter. Alan begged Steph to go after Shelly and bring her home. On the ferry, unknown to Alan, Steph and Shelly argued and Shelly fell overboard. Steph left her to drown, returning to the village, and her relationship with Alan grew stronger. He allowed her to take over the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List_of_residences_in_Emmerdale#The_Grange_B_.26_B|B&amp;amp;B]] &lt;/span&gt;again and Steph later fell in love with local doctor, [[Adam Forsythe]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
