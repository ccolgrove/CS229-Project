Adult sea otters typically weigh between 14 and 45&amp;amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]] (30 to 100&amp;amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]), making them the heaviest members of the [[Mustelidae|weasel family]], but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of [[fur]], the densest in the animal kingdom.  Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sea otter inhabits offshore environments where it dives to the sea floor to [[forage]]. It preys mostly upon marine invertebrates such as [[sea urchin]]s, various [[mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s, and some species of [[fish]]. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects.  First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a [[keystone species]], controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to [[kelp forest]] [[ecosystem]]s.  Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
