  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1938 the Technische Amt decided to include a squadron (''Staffel'') of dive-bombers in the ''Graf Zeppelins''' air groups, the obvious choice being the combat-proven Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Work on converting the Ju 87 B into the carrier version Ju 87 C began later that year. Pre-production Ju 87Cs had manually folded wings, reducing carrier stowage width to just {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}; production series aircraft featured an electrically-actuated wing folding mechanism. Overall wingspan was {{convert|.6|m|abbr=on}} shorter than the Ju 87 B. Catapult attachment points were added to the lower fuselage and an arrester hook was installed just forward of the tail wheel. The fuselage and landing gear were also strengthened to better withstand the stresses of carrier landings. The two propeller-driven sirens normally mounted on the Stukaâs fixed undercarriage legs were deleted, which helped reduce drag.&amp;lt;ref name=Breyer72&amp;gt;Breyer, p.72&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Ju 87 Câs fixed landing gear could be jettisoned via explosive charges in the event it had to ditch over water. This would help minimize the likelihood of the plane flipping over as it touched down. Flotation bags in the body and wings of the plane were installed and sealants applied to seams and openings to delay the aircraftâs sinking should it be forced to make a water landing, thereby giving the crew sufficient time to exit the cockpit and deploy the inflatable rubber dinghy stowed on board for just such emergencies.&amp;lt;ref name=Breyer72/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
