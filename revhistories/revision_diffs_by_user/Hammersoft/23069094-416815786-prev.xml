  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The two kids are shocked and appalled when Byron Swain, a horribly stuck up and high strung kid from their school, appears and conducts their arrest. They protest that magic does not exist but their cries fall on deaf ears. During the arrest, their parents are permitted to give Whit and Wisty one item each. They are given a seemingly worthless book and a drum stick respectively before being led away, and Wisty accidentally sets fire to herself, apparently using magic. In an attempt to stop her Whit accidentally creates a tornado out of anger. A mysterious figure known as The One Who Is The One shows up and it is revealed that he somehow knows their parents and he is the leader of the new political party. He is able to halt their powers in an unknown way. The pair are then taken to a prison which appears to be occupied solely by children, and are interrogated by Byron, during which Wisty once again unconsciously uses magic. They are then put on trial briefly and sentenced to execution, to be carried out when they turn eighteen. Returning from their trial, they see a wanted poster for their parents, who have apparently escaped custody.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
