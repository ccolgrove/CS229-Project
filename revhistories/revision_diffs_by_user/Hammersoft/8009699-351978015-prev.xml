  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rusty is a fictional character from the musical ''[[Starlight Express]]''. He is the protagonist of the musical.  Rusty is a steam engine, relegated to the sidings, who dreams of winning the Championship Engine of the World races. He is roundly mocked for this ambition, as steam is old fashioned, and Diesel and Electric engines now vie for supremacy. When [[Pearl the Observation Car|Pearl]] makes her way onto the scene, he falls madly in love with her and asks if she will be his racing partner. She agrees, as long as no-one better comes along. When she turns him down for newcomer [[Electra the Electric Train|Electra]], he keeps trying to get her attention. Later on, Rusty becomes disheartened and unwilling to race; but then [[Poppa]] tells him about the Starlight Express, a magical train that helps those who call on him. Originally he initially raced with Belle, and lost to Electra. Poppa then, to prove that steam engines can still race, raced in the third heat and won - nearly killing himself. He begs Rusty to take his place in the final, to win for him. Rusty calls on the Starlight Express to help him, and discovers his inner strength. In the end, he wins and Pearl soon realizes that he is the one she loves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
