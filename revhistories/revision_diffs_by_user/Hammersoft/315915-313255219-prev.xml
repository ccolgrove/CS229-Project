Many died from the cruel treatment and disease inflicted upon them and their culture was destroyed. The first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated. The most common sports were &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[            ]], &lt;/span&gt;[[cockfight]]ing and [[dominoes]]. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One of the most popular sports was &quot;Boliche&quot;. The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins. &quot;Boliche&quot; was similar to [[Bowling]]. Another popular sport was [[bullfighting]], which was limited to the larger cities of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unlike in most states of the [[United States]], [[cockfight]]ing is legal in Puerto Rico,  and there are many places that draw large crowds to see bantams fighting every weekend. It is known as the Gentlemans Sport due to the common practice of wagers being a verbal contract between two individuals and may range from $1 to thousands of dollars. Across the world, Puerto Rico has been seen as the largest capital for the controversial sport, as it is incredibly popular and often televised as other sports are.  [[Rooster]]s are specially bred to fight, first entering the ring between one and two years of age.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While [[golf]] is not very popular in Puerto Rico, there are many golf courses across the island. The most famous Puerto Rican golfer is [[Juan &quot;Chi-Chi&quot; RodrÃ­guez]] who was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1992. RodrÃ­guez used to put his hat over the hole whenever he made a [[Golf glossary|birdie]] or [[Golf glossary|eagle]]. After he heard that other golfers were complaining about his little act, he decided to try something new. RodrÃ­guez developed his signature &quot;[[Torero (bullfighter)|toreador]] dance&quot;, where he would make believe that the birdie was a &quot;bull&quot; and that his [[Golf club (equipment)#Types|putter]] was a &quot;sword&quot; and he would terminate the &quot;bull&quot;. RodrÃ­guez represented Puerto Rico on 12 [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] teams. In 1986, he won the [[Hispanic]] Recognition Award. In 1988, he was named [[Replica's Hispanic Man of the Year]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
