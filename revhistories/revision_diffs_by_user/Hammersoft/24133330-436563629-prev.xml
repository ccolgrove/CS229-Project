  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Dugard''' occurred on June 10, 1991, when she was 11 years old. Dugard was [[child abduction|abducted]] from a school bus stop within sight of her home in [[South Lake Tahoe, California]]. Searches began immediately after the kidnapping, but no reliable leads were generated. She remained missing for more than 18 years. On August 26, 2009, Dugard, her daughters, and Phillip Craig Garrido appeared in the office of her kidnapper's [[parole officer]] in [[California]]. Their unusual behavior sparked an investigation that led to the positive identification of Jaycee Lee Dugard, living in a tent behind Garrido's home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
