  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lee first appears on 4 November 2008, when he accompanies his grandfather to Butler's Farm - run by [[Jo Sugden]] - to sort out a problem over cattle. Over the following weeks, Mick and Lee help Jo out with the farm, which she is struggling to run after separating from her abusive husband [[Andy Sugden|Andy]]. Lee is a qualified gamekeeper. He and Jo get on well from the start, and when in mid-December 2008, he has to remove his shirt after fixing some plumbing, Mick warns him not to flirt with Jo too much. In late December, Lee catches Andy sabotaging the washing machine so Jo will ask him over to do the repair. They get into a fight, and Andy is thrown out. Jo decides she needs to leave the village, and Lee agrees to help her. She leaves on 22 December.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Lee, already planning to apply for a gamekeeper job elsewhere, packs his bags that day and leaves the village.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
