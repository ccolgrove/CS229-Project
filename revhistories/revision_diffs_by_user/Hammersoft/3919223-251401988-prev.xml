Andrea's last name was never revealed on the show or in any affiliated sources (although she was rumored to be related to Principal Li), but she was a relatively regular character, appearing often, if not always in a speaking role.  She has a darkly [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] personality, as evidenced by her poetry, and works a parent-enforced part-time job as a stock clerk in a local [[Sams Club]] like warehouse store.  She was deeply fearful of Daria and Jane discovering this last fact and mocking her (since she is aware of Daria and Jane's reputation for making fun of the other students), but was pleasantly surprised when the intimidating pair assured her that they understood her position. In the finale movie, &quot;Is It College Yet?&quot;, she is the only female student who actually takes a liking to Upchuck and ends up dating him. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Brittany was an exemplifying perpetuation of the prejudiced stereotypes about blonde-haired girls. She had the trademark of both a dazzlingly low intellect and an extremely high-pitched voice, which would frequently squeak in mid sentence. It is of note, however, that despite poor grades and a general lack of common sense, Brittany has shown that a greater intellect may lie beneath the surface, such as when she spontaneously devised a masterful battle strategy during a school-sponsored paintball game in &quot;The Daria Hunter&quot;, reciting the balcony scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' from memory in &quot;Lucky Strike&quot;, and a powerful motivational speech she gave to Daria when Daria was feeling hypocritical for being obsessed with her looks in &quot;Through A Lens Darkly&quot;. From the beginning of the series, Brittany was romantically involved with fellow student Kevin (see ''The Football Team'' below). She tended to treat Daria and Jane with a large degree of condescension but wasn't mean to them. Brittany is voiced by [[Janie Mertz]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Jodie was constantly searching for more extracurricular activities and other selling points for her college rÃ©sumÃ©.  Since the beginning of the series, Jodie was romantically involved with fellow black student &quot;Mack&quot; (see ''The Football Team''). She became friends with Daria and Jane and seemed to admire the way Daria in particular said and did what she felt like doing, while Jodie had to pretty much structure her life to fulfill her parents' high expectations. By the series' end, she was able to convince her parents to let her attend a majority African-American college and remained happily together with Mack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
