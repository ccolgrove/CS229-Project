  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The episode &quot;[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek)|Metamorphosis]]&quot;, also from the original series, establishes a backstory for the invention of warp drive, stating that it was invented by [[Zefram Cochrane]]. Cochrane is repeatedly referred to afterwards, but the exact details of the first warp trials were not shown until the second ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' movie, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. The movie depicts Cochrane as having invented warp drive on Earth in 2063 (two years after the date speculated by the first edition of the [[Chronological list of Star Trek stories|Star Trek Chronology]]). By using a matter/antimatter reactor to create [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and by sending this plasma through warp coils, he created a warp bubble which he could use to move a craft into [[Subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] and hence exceed the speed of light. This successful first trial led directly to first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
