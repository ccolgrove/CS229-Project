  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Australian broadcaster, the [[Seven Network]], included in its coverage an irreverent talk show called [[The Dream with Roy and HG#The Ice Dream|The Ice Dream]], which interviewed several celebrities and promoted the [[Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid]]. Steven Bradbury and Alisa Camplin's triumphs were celebrated by [[Australia post]] issuing stamps of them, which followed on from them issuing stamps of Australian gold medallists at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]]. They were produced by high-speed offset stamp-printing, unlike the digitally produced 2000 stamps. Bradbury's stamp was issued on February 20, and Alisa's was issued on February 22, four days after their respective victories. Each received [[Australian dollar|A$]]20,000 for the use of their image. Steven Bradbury said âShould get me a car. I havenât had a car for a long time.â and later described having a stamp issued as &quot;a great honour&quot;. Alisa was also delighted, saying âFor us to be put in with the summer Olympians who had their stamps and the previous 39 sporting legends whoâve had their stamps is amazing.â&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
