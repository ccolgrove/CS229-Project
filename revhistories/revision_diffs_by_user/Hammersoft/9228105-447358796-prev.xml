  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nag Hammadi bindings were constructed with a textblock of [[papyrus]] sheets, assembled into a single section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the outer sheets.  Because the inner sheets were narrower than the outer sheets after trimming, the width of text varied through the textblock, and it is likely that the papyrus was not written on until ''after'' it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Szirmai, 12-13.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Turner points out that a scribe ''could'', however, insert a single leaf either in the middle of the book or at the end; some evidence points to this having been done in two of the Nag Hammadi codices.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with waste sheets of papyrus.  The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement.  These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Szirmai, 9-10.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the fore edge of the book when closed.  Attached to the flap was a long leather thong which was wrapped around the book two or three times, and which served as a clasp to keep the book securely shut.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Szirmai, 9.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Greenfield |first=Jane |title=ABC of Bookbinding |year=2002 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press |location=New Castle, DE |isbn=1-884718-41-8 |pages=80â81 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
