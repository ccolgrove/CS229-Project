The sword developed from the [[dagger]] when the construction of longer blades became possible, from the late 3rd millennium BC in the middle-east, first in arsenic copper, then in tin-bronze. The oldest sword-like weapons are found at [[Arslantepe]], [[Turkey]], and date to around 3300 BC. It's however believed that these are longer daggers, and not the first ancestors of swords. Swords longer than 60&amp;amp;nbsp;cm were rare and not practical during the Bronze Age as at longer lengths the [[tensile strength]] of [[bronze]] starts to decrease radically, which means such long swords would bend easily. It was not until the development of stronger alloys such as [[steel]] , and improved [[heat treatment]] processess that longswords became practical for [[combat]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Some of the early swords typically had small and slender  blades intended for thrusting. Later swords were broader and were both cutting and thrusting weapons. A typical variant for European swords is the leaf-shaped blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, in the UK and Ireland in particular.
