  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;''Guitar Hero'' was created from a partnership between [[RedOctane]], then their own company that produced specialized gaming controllers, and [[Harmonix Music Systems]], a [[music video game]] development company who had previously produced ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'', ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'' and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''. RedOctane was seeking to bring in a ''[[GuitarFreaks]]''-like game, highly popular at the time in Japan, into the Western markets, and approached Harmonix about helping them to develop a music game around a guitar controller.

Activision followed suit with the release of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, which supported multiple instruments. In 2009, Activision tripled its ''Guitar Hero'' offerings, and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'' and expansions, they introduced the titles ''[[Band Hero]]'', geared towards more family-friendly [[pop music]], and ''[[DJ Hero]]'', a game based on [[turntablism]] and featuring a number of [[DJ mix|mixes]].
