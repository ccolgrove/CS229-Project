  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first depicted by European-Americans dressed in mock traditional attire.  Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965-67). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949-57) and [[Iron Eyes Cody]] came to prominence.  Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture.  In the 1970s some Native Americans roles were improved in movies: ''[[Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976) depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
