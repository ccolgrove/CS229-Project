  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''''Flying Cloud''''' of 1851 was the most famous of the extreme [[clipper]]s built by [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston, Massachusetts]], intended for [[Enoch Train]] of [[Boston]], who paid $50,000 for her construction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ''Flying Cloud'' was purchased at launching by [[Grinnell, Minturn &amp;amp; Co|Grinnell, Minturn &amp;amp; Co.]], of New York, for $90,000, which represented a huge profit for Train &amp;amp; Co. Within six weeks she sailed from [[New York]] and made [[San Francisco]] 'round [[Cape Horn]] in 89 [[day]]s, 21 [[hour]]s under the command of Captain [[Josiah Perkins Creesy]]. On [[July 31]], during the trip, she made 374 miles in 24 hours. In 1853 she beat her own record by 13 hours, a record that stood until 1989 when the breakthrough-designed [[sailboat]] ''Thursday's Child'' completed the passage in 80 days, 20 hours. The record was once again broken 2008 by the French racing yacht [[Gitana yacht|Gitana 13]] with a time of 43 days and 38 minutes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
