  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Played by [[Roseanne Barr]]. Born in late 1952, Roseanne, in a take off of her stand-up comedic persona and presumed real-life persona, is a bossy, loud, caustic, and dominant woman. She frequently meddles and tries to control the lives of her husband, daughters, son, sister, and friends.  Despite her dominating nature, Roseanne is a loving mother who works hard and makes as much time for her kids as possible.  She, like her family, deals with the many hardships of poverty and domestic troubles with humor.  She worked at the Wellman Plastics [[factory]] at the beginning of the show's run and quit that job after conflict with the new egotistical domineering boss, Mr. Faber; she led a walkout that included most of her friends. She had several periods of unemployment and held jobs as a fast-food employee, a telemarketer, a bartender, and a shampoo woman/hair sweeper at a beauty salon. Subsequently, she worked for several years as a waitress in the luncheonette at Rodbell's [[department store]] (much to the chagrin of daughters Becky and Darlene, who regularly hung out there).  She eventually co-owned a successful restaurant called the Lanford Lunch Box with Jackie, her mother Bev,  and Nancy (as well as her nemesis Leon, her boss from the luncheonette, who assumed partial ownership of the restaurant after mother Bev sold her share to him). In the ninth (and fictional) season, Roseanne (along with Jackie) gave up her control of the restaurant to Leon and her friend Nancy after winning the lottery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Played by [[John Goodman]]. Born in 1951, Dan is a genial, easygoing man who loves the gregarious, bossy, loud Roseanne as she is.  He appears to be dominated by her but has his own strong personality, too, which keeps the boundaries clear. He has a very good sense of humor, often making jokes about his wife's bossiness (once joking ''I'm not Mrs. Conner, I'm a normal human being''). Other than his poker buddies (Dan bonding with them parallels the bonding his wife does with Jackie and her other female friends), being easygoing in spite of his family problems, Dan eventually, following extremely trying situations brought on by both, learns to get along with the men in his daughters' lives, particularly Mark and David. Both men end up seeing Dan as a father figure, and he begrudgingly returns the affection much in the way that his caustic wife ultimately cares for her cantankerous children.  He is frequently unemployed, but he is a hard worker when he is on the job.  Throughout the run of the show, he does [[drywall]], construction, owns a failing bike shop, works as a bus inspector for the city [[government]], and then retires upon hitting the lottery.  In the final season, he briefly moved to [[California]] to take care of his mentally ill mother. While there, he becomes involved in an affair with one of his mother's nurses, which he soon ended. In the last episode, it is discovered that Dan had really died of the heart attack at the end of the eighth season and that the series was a story written by Roseanne taken from real events, in which she changed it to Dan surviving as a way to cope with the tragedy and whatever she did not like about her real life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Played by [[Laurie Metcalf]]. Born in 1955, Jackie is Roseanne's younger sister by three years. Jackie is an intelligent, warm, highly sensitive underachiever who often lacks faith in herself.  Roseanne seems to be in charge of Jackie's life, which is a frequent cause of conflict between the two; however, Jackie sometimes enjoys having Roseanne mother her, especially when Jackie feels vulnerable. Jackie's character seems to become more animated and colorful as the series progresses.  She begins the series as a single woman on the prowl, then after a traumatic experience with an abusive boyfriend which also triggers buried memories of her father's belt beatings, her deeply troubled side comes out more and for a while, she appears to be affected by [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], but after a failed marriage and giving birth, becomes much freer, somewhat zany with her creative, wacky side coming out more.  Jackie has held numerous jobs; she was working in the Wellman Plastics factory for several years until the walkout, then became a police officer until she was injured on the job, and later was a truck driver, and then opened the Lanford Lunch Box with Roseanne and Nancy. Jackie often comes up with seemingly off-the-wall &quot;crazy&quot; ideas, but it turns out that many of her unconventional ideas actually work. Her romantic relationships were frequently unstable, including one where she dated a man named Fisher and became the victim of [[domestic violence]]. However, she did eventually marry Dan's co-worker Fred, who impregnated her after a one-night stand and who only got the idea to propose to her in the &quot;perfect way&quot; by taking notes from Jackie's favorite soap opera, ''[[One Life to Live]]''.  Jackie gave birth to their son, Andy, two months before she married Fred.  At one point Jackie, getting bored with Fred, starts going out with another man.  Dan catches her, and tells Fred, at which point Fred leaves.  Roseanne tricks him into deciding that he's over-reacting, and he goes back. However, at this point Jackie is realizing that she's happier being single. The marriage would prove to be short-lived because Jackie found Fred &quot;boring&quot; and they fell out of love.  Jackie is crushed by the divorce at first, but she then moves on to become a successful single mom to Andy and continues running the diner with Roseanne, Nancy, and Leon.  She was partly the beneficiary of the winning lottery ticket in the final season.  At the time of Andy's birth, Jackie's full name is revealed to be Marjorie by Beverly; however, older sister Roseanne supposedly could only pronounce Marjorie as ''My Jackie'', and the nickname stuck.  Before Beverly telling Jackie about her name, she did not even know about it herself. Despite Jackie's apparent flightiness in the early episodes, Jackie is actually the backbone of the Conner/Harris family in many ways, as Roseanne admits in the last episode.  Roseanne, Dan and each of the kids often come to Jackie for help since she is kind, a very good listener and usually gives very good advice. When the ninth season was revealed as fictional in the last episode, it was discovered that Jackie was a [[lesbian]]; Roseanne penned her as heterosexual because she always imagined her with men.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Born in 1975, Becky, the oldest of Roseanne and Dan's kids, is quite bright and is an overachiever, but she is also somewhat quick-tempered and sometimes angry with her parents and younger sister Darlene. She dates her rebellious biker boyfriend Mark Healy against her parents' wishes and then, at age 17, leaves home to marry him and move to [[Minneapolis]].  Later, Becky and Mark return home to live with Roseanne and Dan and then move out again into a trailer. In the final episode, it is revealed that she is pregnant and that Mark is the father, until it is later revealed that her relationship with Mark was actually a product of her mother's imagination, for the purpose of her book, and Becky actually married David Healy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Played by [[Sara Gilbert]]. Born in late 1976, Darlene in the early years was a &quot;[[tomboy]]&quot; who loved sports, but at puberty she became moody, artistic, an [[animal rights]] activist, and a [[vegetarian]] to more closely match the real-life views and personality of [[Sara Gilbert]]. During her freshman year of high school, she begins dating David. (David is the younger brother of Becky's husband, Mark.) Darlene possesses the same sarcasm and domineering attitude as her mother, often causing the two to clash.  Her bossy nature is best seen with David, who usually gives in to her will.  Darlene is a very talented writer. Along with David's artistic talents, they began working seriously on a [[graphic novel]], and Darlene eventually applies for and is awarded early admission and a scholarship to an exclusive art school in [[Chicago]] before she finishes high school, which Roseanne allows her to attend after realizing it is her only chance to get out of Lanford and make a better life for herself as the writer Roseanne never was able to accomplish being. While in college, she met a boy named Jimmy, who she dated while still with David.  David was aware she was dating Jimmy, but eventually told her she had to choose between them.  She chose Jimmy. Later on he dumped her because he couldn't get close to her. She later became pregnant by David and soon marries him. She eventually finished art school and later gave birth to her daughter, Harris.  Harris is born very prematurely and almost doesn't survive, but by the support of her family and her own endurance, she survives and becomes a healthy child by the series' end. It is revealed in the final episode that Darlene actually had married Mark, not David.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Born in 1981, DJ was a lonely, bizarre, and unpopular child who was frequently taunted by his sisters and peers.  He is portrayed as being something of a simpleton in school and abnormally weird, as in the time he peeked at both Darlene and Becky naked at different times, as well as the time Becky found dismembered [[Barbie doll]]s under his bed. As a teenager, he showed interest in filmmaking and eventually found a girlfriend who shared his interests.  One episode dealt with DJ's relationship in a mature way, showing the couple's decision not to rush into a deep commitment too soon. In Season 3, it is also stated that while Becky and Darlene were planned pregnancies for the Conners, DJ was a &quot;surprise&quot;.  Later in the series, it is mentioned that [[Jose Cuervo]] [[Tequila]] was responsible for the interlude that lead to DJ's conception.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

He is portrayed as being something of a simpleton in school and abnormally weird, as in the time he peeked at both Darlene and Becky naked at different times, as well as the time Becky found dismembered [[Barbie doll]]s under his bed. As a teenager, he showed interest in filmmaking and eventually found a girlfriend who shared his interests.  One episode dealt with DJ's relationship in a mature way, showing the couple's decision not to rush into a deep commitment too soon. In Season 3, it is also stated that while Becky and Darlene were planned pregnancies for the Conners, DJ was a &quot;surprise&quot;.  Later in the series, it is mentioned that [[Jose Cuervo]] [[Tequila]] was responsible for the interlude that lead to DJ's conception.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
