  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;*For military tactics, Joan's &quot;Audacity&quot; was compared to William's &quot;Feigned Retreat&quot;. At the Siege of OrlÃ©ans, Joan snuck some of her forces into OrlÃ©ans and then ordered them to regroup for a bold, frontal attack on the English Siege Post which succeeded in lifting the siege and saving OrlÃ©ans from capitulation. At the Battle of Hastings, William's initial attack was foiled by the English being in a Shield Wall formation on top of a hill. By feigning a retreat, he deceived them into breaking their shield wall formation and coming off the high ground which allowed his forces to inflict significant casualties on the pursuing English forces. With their ranks thinned out and their shield wall reduced in effectiveness, William ordered his archers to fire on the rear of the English army which succeeded in inflicting further casualties and mortally wounding Harold Godwinson, clinching the victory for the Normans. The edge was given to William's &quot;Feigned Retreat&quot; for the greater tactical significance of his Victory at Hastings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
