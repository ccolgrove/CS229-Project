  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''Gallic rooster''' ({{lang-fr|le coq gaulois}}) is a [[national symbol]] of [[France]] as a nation and its history, land and culture (as opposed to [[Marianne]] representing France as a State, and its values : [[French Republic|the Republic]]). Its association with France is due to the play on words in [[Latin language|Latin]] between ''Gallus'', meaning an inhabitant of [[Gaul]], and ''gallus'', meaning [[rooster]], or cockerel. Although its use in France dates to the [[Middle Ages]], it gained particular popularity during the [[French Revolution]], and has been a national emblem ever since. The rooster was featured on the reverse of French 20-franc gold pieces from 1899 to 1914. After World War I it was depicted on many war memorials.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
