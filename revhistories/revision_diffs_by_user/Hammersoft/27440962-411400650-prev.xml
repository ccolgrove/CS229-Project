He recounted the story of Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]], whose [[kippa]], skullcap, had to be discarded after the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]], because it was covered in blood after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines, and so a Catholic chaplain, Fr. George Pucciarelli, tore a piece of his camouflage uniform off, to be used as a temporary replacement for the kippa.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Wellsprings, No. 12 (Vol 2, No. 7), August-September 1986,Lubavitch Youth Organizations.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Reagan thanked the group in an official February 12, 1985, White House letter to Rabbi [[Abraham Shemtov]], the organization's national director, ending with the prayer: &quot;May the light of the menorah always be a source of strength and inspiration to the Jewish people and to all mankind.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/142535/jewish/The-Rebbe-and-President-Reagan.htm &quot;The Rebbe and President Reagan, 1984.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Reagan also began to use the term [[Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian heritage]] more and more during his presidency, and in a radio address on Dec 26, 1987, spoke of the link of both Hanukkah and Christmas &quot;as two religious observances that go to the heart of America's Judeo-Christian heritage.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=33869 Ronald Reagan Radio Address to the Nation on Volunteerism, Dec 26, 1987.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
