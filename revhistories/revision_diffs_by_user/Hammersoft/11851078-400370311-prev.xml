  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Melvin Van Horne''', better known as '''Sideshow Mel''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]), is [[Krusty the Clown]]'s sidekick. He replaced [[Sideshow Bob]] after Bob was incarcerated for [[Krusty Gets Busted|framing Krusty for armed robbery]]. Mel's hiring was never explicitly shown in the series and his full name was only revealed when he announced himself while trying to solve the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns in the episode &quot;[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?#Part two|Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)]]&quot; and in the episode &quot;[[All About Lisa]]&quot; on the portrait of Sideshow Mel in the past. He first appeared in &quot;[[Itchy &amp;amp; Scratchy &amp;amp; Marge]]&quot;, shortly after Sideshow Bob was sent to prison, filling the exact role that Bob once did. Little is known about Mel. He is a [[Cornell University]] graduate, and a former ''Gulp 'n Blow'' employee. Sideshow Mel is revealed, in the episode entitled &quot;All About Lisa&quot;, to have been the winner of the prestigious Springfield Entertainer of the Year award. The intoxication of applause made him reduce himself to ridiculous behavior for laughter, which he compared to heroin and checking email. Sideshow Mel uses a [[slide whistle]] to communicate on camera just like Bob. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose [[United Kingdom|British]]/[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]an accent (Castellaneta's play on [[Kelsey Grammer]]'s character, [[Sideshow Bob]]) and owns poodles. When Springfield inhabitants form an angry mob, Mel often takes a leading role. Mel wears a bone in his hair, which was revealed to be permanently stuck in his hair in the episode &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot; thanks to a failed attempt to remove gum from his hair; however, in &quot;[[The Bart of War]]&quot; the bone is shown to be removable when Mel takes it out of his hair and uses it as a weapon. He also uses it to bat at the dome in ''The Simpsons Movie'' almost immediately after it is first laid over the town. It was also removed by Bart in &quot;[[Dial 'N' for Nerder]]&quot; (which holds Mel's flowing, long locks of hair). In &quot;[[Homerazzi]]&quot; it was revealed that Mel was in a bitter [[child custody|custody]] battle and that he has a son, who looks just like him except without a bone in his hair. In &quot;[[I'm with Cupid]]&quot;, he reveals he has a wife called Barbara, who appears in &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;. She is also seen with Mel playing bowling in a house that Marge tries to sell in the same episode. She is revealed to be giving birth in the episode All About Lisa, suggesting that Mel has at least two children. She looks like a European woman, and has light hair. When Bart was Krusty's valet/assistant, he mistakenly gave the lactose intolerant Mel a cheese sandwich. The result was a vomit laden harangue of Bart from the washroom as Bart stood outside.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
