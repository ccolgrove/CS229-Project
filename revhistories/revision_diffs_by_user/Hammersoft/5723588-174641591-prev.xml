  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the Famicom version of Final Fantasy III, the playable characters are four children who are granted special powers from the Light Crystals to take up the Quest of Light. The four are orphans who are raised at the remote village of Ur by the priest, Topapa. When the Wind Crystal sinks to the earth due to an earthquake one day, the four, dressed as Onion Knights, go to investigate. They manage to get lost but eventually stumble upon the Crystal. The Crystal tells them of Xande's plans to conquer the world using Darkness, which could upset the balance of Light and Dark and lead to detrimental effects. It proceeds to bestow the Legendary Job Classes upon the four. From there on, the four become Warriors of the Light, and leave Ur in their quest. Granted the power of the Light, the Warriors begin to combat the darkness that increasingly consumes the world. As the other Crystals they encounter provide them more Jobs, the four become a formidable party to deal with. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She first met Luneth and Arc on Cid's Airship, which she helped build, when Kazus became affected by Djinn's curse, and decided to join them. Refia has a cheerful and active personality and tends to force her opinions on others. Therefore, she is frequently at odds with Luneth, though she did seem to show some jealously when he flirted with princess Sara. She becomes one of Desch's best friends during their journey together, and she tries to help regain his memory and reunite him with his girlfriend in Canaan. She hates toads and is dismayed to realize that the party will have to change into them in order to enter the Tower of Owen.
