It looks like a [[skull]] with a [[snake]] coming out of the mouth in place of the [[tongue]]. As a spell it is cast by a [[Death Eater]] whenever he or she has murdered someone. The spell used by Death Eaters to conjure the Mark is [[Morsmordre]]. It first appears in ''Goblet of Fire'' and is described as a &quot;colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue.&quot; Once in the sky it was &quot;blazing in a haze of greenish smoke.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
