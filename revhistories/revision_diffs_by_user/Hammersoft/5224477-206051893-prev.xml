Though satire was only a part of these shows and much of its humour was essentially harmless he came into publicity with satire about Dutch show business personalities who were often ridiculed. Besides, many obscure musical acts were featured in his shows, many of which managed to gain national fame after they had been in De Leeuw's show (e.g. [[Twarres]] and AIDS suffering singer [[RenÃ© Klijn]]). VARA has since continued his shows apart from a few interruptions, often with considerable success.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
