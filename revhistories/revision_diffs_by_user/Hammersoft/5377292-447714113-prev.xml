  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eli - a penniless drifter, just released from prison - turned up unannounced on his uncle [[Zak Dingle]]'s doorstep and was told he was unwelcome. No one was pleased to see Eli - not even his older brother Marlon. It was soon clear Eli had gotten them into plenty of mischief in the past. Eli then witnessed the terrifying King's River showhome collapse which killed several villagers. Eli helped in the rescue and later defended his cousin [[Sam Dingle]] and his terminally ill wife Alice against [[Cain Dingle]]. Zak agreed to let Eli stay, but he soon got into trouble when Marlon emotionally blackmailed him into obtaining the morphine Sam used in the assisted suicide of [[Alice Dingle]]. Eli was disowned when Zak found out he had provided the morphine. He returned when Sam found him living rough in the woods on the run from some vicious drug dealers. After the men attacked Marlon trying to discover his whereabouts, Eli came up with a plan to frame them for armed robbery at the post office. His scheme worked and Zak accepted Eli back into the family.            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

This was caught on film by [[Debbie Dingle]] who used it to blackmail Kelly. After Jimmy dumped Kelly at the altar, Eli helped her leave town by stealing Debbie's car. Eli later began an on/off relationship with his cousin Debbie after agreeing to help her with some money-making schemes, including pretending to be [[Scott Windsor]] in order for her to obtain a loan to buy his garage business. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;When a local bookmaker refused to pay out, Marlon decided to rob the bookies in revenge. Eli initially tried to talk him out of it, but eventually helped plan the robbery. Marlon was shocked to discover Eli had brought a gun and he pulled out of the plan. Worried, Marlon later intervened to stop Eli, but the gun went off accidentally and Marlon was shot in the chest. Marlon recovered, but was angry with Eli. When a story about him being a hero appeared, Marlon was rewarded for his supposed bravery with enough money to buy himself and Donna a house, Eli was jealous and began to blackmail his brother. Zak eventually found out what was going on and physically attacked Eli, calling him a &quot;snivelling little traitor&quot;.             &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
