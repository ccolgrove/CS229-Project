  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;''Time''{{'}}s most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual &quot;Person of the Year&quot; (formerly &quot;Man of the Year&quot;) cover story, in which ''Time'' recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news. Despite the title, the recipient is not necessarily individuals or even human beings &amp;amp;ndash; for instance, on January 3, 1983 the [[personal computer]] was recognized as &quot;Machine of the Year&quot; (Time.com). In 1989 &quot;Endangered Earth&quot; was named as &quot;Planet Of The Year.&quot; In 1999, [[Albert Einstein]] was chosen by ''Time'' as Person of the Century.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Controversy has occasionally arisen because of the designation of alleged dictators and warmongers as &quot;Persons of the Year&quot;. The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, for good or ill, has most affected the course of the year; it is therefore not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] have been Man of the Year. In 2001, Time was accused of giving way to political correctness when it named [[Rudy Giuliani]] Person of the Year instead of [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
