He fights with [[katar]]s, dual blades attached to his arms, with which he repeatedly slices his enemies in his Limit Break, ''Blood Pain''. His weapons' name is given as &quot;katal&quot; in the English localization of the game. Following the failed mission in Centra, Kiros is separated from Laguna and Ward. He heals quickly and decides to leave the Galbadian army, but soon finds that life without Laguna lacks excitement. His subsequent search for Laguna brings him to Winhill after nearly a year.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;'''Kiros:''' &quot;Thank you, for taking care of Laguna. I was able to recover in about a month or so.
