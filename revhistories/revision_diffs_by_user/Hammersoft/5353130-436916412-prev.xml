Denny considers himself a legend and loves to say his own name to &quot;sign&quot; his verbal utterances. In one of the final episodes of ''The Practice'', he explained that often people don't believe they're in the room with a legend, so he says his own name to let them know it's true. Denny has no problem sleeping with the wives of judges and clients. He is a conservative who believes gun control is for &quot;communists&quot; and refuses to defend anyone who is accused of extremely heinous acts; in one episode, he shoots a client because of the nature of his crime (raping and murdering a child). Denny is also a womanizer. Though he marries another woman in Season 2, he still pines for Shirley Schmidt.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Illicit computer hacking, blackmail, disguise, and bribery are all tools he uses without hesitation. Alan is, however, unwavering in his defense of the underdog (unless he is representing the other party) and an indefatigable patron of various [[left-wing]] causes. He is disappointed and disillusioned with how the country has changed in recent years, and routinely confronts these issues in open court. Wherever he works, he treats his coworkers with levity and refuses to take himself seriously. Alan suffers from [[night terrors]], has a fear of clowns, and in two episodes, suffered from [[word salad (mental health)|word salad]]. He has resigned himself to the fact that he will never be made partner at the firm due to his unpredictable behavior and lack of trustworthiness. He is best friends with [[Denny Crane]]. Alan is also an obscene womanizer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
