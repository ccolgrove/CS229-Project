He attracted the attention of [[Internet Haganah|Aaron Weisburd]] on a forum called &quot;Islamic Terrorists&quot;, where he initially appeared to be a harmless agitator, &quot;At first I started publishing bits and pieces of what he was doing online for comic relief, and really had no appreciation of where he was headed&quot;. Tsouli and Weisburd taunted each other online &quot;I would give him a message like, 'Your days are numbered â youâre going to get caught'.

There, he gained a reputation as a resident expert on Internet technologies, especially on matters on both enhancing and defeating on-line security.  He was well known as someone who could break into a web site and hide files containing al-Qaeda propaganda on these sites (examples of such propaganda include the [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] produced film ''All Is for Allah's Religion'', the al-Qaeda Internet magazine  ''[[Voice of Jihad]]'' (Sawt al Jihad), and videos of the beheading of Americans [[Nick Berg]], [[Jack Hensley]] and [[Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.]]).  He would then post links to these covert files on the forums he belonged to.  He also mentored other volunteers on the art of computer cracking, both by answering questions on-line and through an al-Ekhlas posting entitled âSeminar on Hacking Websitesâ.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
