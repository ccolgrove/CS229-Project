Another running joke with this character is that his mother, called Carol, is said at various points to be sexually available, possibly working as a prostitute. She sometimes walks around topless, which impresses Jimbo's friends. In the episode &quot;[[Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot!]]&quot;, he, Dolph, and Kearney ask [[Snake Jailbird]] for steroids, which shows he is a drug addict.

He was in third grade with [[Otto Mann]], celebrated the [[United States Bicentennial]], remembers the [[Watergate]] scandal, regularly shaves, and has custody of a child who sounds like [[Ralph Wiggum]] and looks like Kearney courtesy of a divorce. According to the season 13 episode, ''[[She of Little Faith]]'', Kearney dated Jimbo's mother, claiming that &quot;she came onto me!&quot;, and as a result he was beaten up by the rest of the gang and [[Bart Simpson]]&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;She of Little Faith&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite episode |title= She of Little Faith |episodelink= She of Little Faith |series= The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |airdate= 2001-12-16 |season=13 |number=6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. He often relies on (or tricks) [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] into procuring alcohol for himself and his friends (as seen in [[The Springfield Connection]] and [[Last Tap Dance in Springfield]]), though some of the references made would suggest Kearney is of age to buy alcohol for himself. Kearney's last name was revealed (in a computer file) on the season 18 episode, &quot;[[24 Minutes]]&quot;.  According to the season eight episode, [[Lisa's Date with Density]], Kearney drives a [[Hyundai]] (though in [[A Milhouse Divided]], he was seen riding the bus with his school-age son).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Although he looks and sounds to be around [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]] or [[Dolph (Simpsons)|Dolph]]'s age, he is revealed to be much older, and may possibly still be in school just because he is being held back for his behavior. He was in third grade with [[Otto Mann]], celebrated the [[United States Bicentennial]], remembers the [[Watergate]] scandal, regularly shaves, and has custody of a child who sounds like [[Ralph Wiggum]] and looks like Kearney courtesy of a divorce. According to the season 13 episode, ''[[She of Little Faith]]'', Kearney dated Jimbo's mother, claiming that &quot;she came onto me!&quot;, and as a result he was beaten up by the rest of the gang and [[Bart Simpson]]&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;She of Little Faith&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite episode |title= She of Little Faith |episodelink= She of Little Faith |series= The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |airdate= 2001-12-16 |season=13 |number=6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. He often relies on (or tricks) [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] into procuring alcohol for himself and his friends (as seen in [[The Springfield Connection]] and [[Last Tap Dance in Springfield]]), though some of the references made would suggest Kearney is of age to buy alcohol for himself. Kearney's last name was revealed (in a computer file) on the season 18 episode, &quot;[[24 Minutes]]&quot;.  According to the season eight episode, [[Lisa's Date with Density]], Kearney drives a [[Hyundai]] (though in [[A Milhouse Divided]], he was seen riding the bus with his school-age son).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Wendell Borton''' is a perpetually nauseated and extremely pale boy with worried eyes and curly hair, who first appeared in ''[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]''. His first speaking appearance was in ''[[Homer's Odyssey]]''. He makes frequent appearances at the School Nurse's Office at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. He is a classmate of [[Bart Simpson]], though he is most seen with classmates Richard and Lewis, and voted for Martin Prince, thus making Bart lose in the class election, ensuring the victory of [[Martin Prince]]. He cannot keep any food down, most notably [[corn dog]]s, [[french fries]], [[mystery meat]], [[Gordita]]s, the [[McRib]], [[chicken wings]], [[sausage]], [[liver]], [[tapioca]], and [[tofu]]. He becomes especially sick on [[field trip]]s, with a tendency to become even paler than usual. He once died in a freak accident with a pencil in a ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode (which are not [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] to the main series). He is one of the few characters (like Bart, Lisa &amp;amp; Maggie) whose hair is the same color as his skin. Although a friendship with Bart is hinted (Bart choosing to say his apparent last words to him in ''[[Das Bus]]''), Wendell is commonly mistaken for Lewis, despite the difference in their skin color.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
