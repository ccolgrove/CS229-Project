  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Emotional Selection Theory''' is a [[Psychological|psychological]] and theory of [[dreaming]] developed by Richard Coutts and published in the April [[2008]] issue of [http://www.ammonsscientific.com/ Psychological Reports]. The theory describes a process that executes a set of [[dreams]] during [[non-REM sleep]] that modifies [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]] in a process [[Jean Piaget]] referred to as [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodation]]. Because [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] exist as a [[network]], [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] can introduce accidental, maladaptive conflicts and therefore need to be tested before integrated. Consequently, during [[REM sleep]] a second set of [[dreams]] is executed in the form of [[scenario testing|test scenarios]]. If [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] performed during prior [[non-REM]] [[dreams]] alleviate anxiety, frustration, sadness, or in other ways appear [[emotionally|emotions]] adaptive, they would be selected for retention. Those modifications that compare negatively to existing, unchanged [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] would be abandoned or further modified and tested. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Ð­Ð¼Ð¾ - ÑÐ»ÑÑÐ¸.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Schema (psychology)|Schemas]] are both crucial for [[evolution|evolutionary]] success by helping a person adapt to a social environment. Furthermore, [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] are riddled with conflict, which is why Coutts asserts that they are modified and tested with dreams during sleep. We strive for independence, for example, yet find solace in the company of others; we place a high priority on our personal safety, yet quickly jeopardize it to help those in need; we are sexually attracted to many people, yet seek loving, [[monogamous]] relationships. [[Schema (psychology)|Schemas]] help strike the balances necessary for navigating the complex, often contradictory landscape that comprises life. This new dream theory explains how [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] are modified and tested during sleep, greatly increasing a personâs ability to meet social needs during wakefulness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
