  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hawaii has four federal highways: [[Interstate H-1|H-1]], [[Interstate H-2|H-2]], [[Interstate H-3|H-3]], and [[Interstate H-201|H-201]], all located on O{{okina}}ahu and all part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. With the exception of H-201, which begins and ends on H-1, all the highways have at least one end point at or near a current or former military installation. A [[List of Hawaii state highways|system of state highways]] encircles the each main island. Travel can be slow due to narrow winding roads on the coastlines. Travel can be significantly congested during morning and evening commute times in and out of Honolulu, particularly on the leeward side. H1 was constructed after Honolulu was well established, and on/off ramps are diverted throughout the city.  Honolulu's public transit system, known as [[TheBus (Honolulu)|TheBus]], was ranked number one in the country for 1994-1995 and again in 2000-2001 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.enterprisehonolulu.com/html/display.cfm?sid=164 Public Transportation in Honolulu O{{okina}}ahu Hawaii]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
