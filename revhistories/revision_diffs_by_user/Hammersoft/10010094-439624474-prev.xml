On September 18, 1995, WAJB switched its callsign to WZZI. The station was sold and switched to [[modern rock]] in 1999, separating itself from mainly [[classic rock]] WROV-FM and [[WBRW]] in Blacksburg. On February 9, 2004, the station became an [[oldies]] station calling itself Oldies 101.5 and later, in November 2004, the station was sold and started calling itself Bob FM. The station performed marginally along with 97.9 in Lynchburg, and in 2006 the new owners attempted a broader-based rock format similar to [[WWWV]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and [[WNOR]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. Om October 12, 2009, WZZI became WVMP with an Adult Album Alternative format as &quot;101.5 The Music Place&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
