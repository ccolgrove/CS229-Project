He wears a [[zoot suit]] and his headquarters is a basement [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurant. Instead of merely dressing up like the Tooth Fairy and procuring the money, he has an entire [[assembly line]] of employees who procure the teeth and inspect them for quality. When the boys attempt to break off into their own independent syndicate, Loogie intervenes and targets Kenny to teach them a lesson (which is a spoof on common Mafia practices). He is voiced primarily by [[Richard Belzer]], although the final recordings were performed by [[Trey Parker]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;On the DVD Commentary, Parker and Stone mention that this was because Belzer could not be at the recording studio at 4am.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He made another cameo appearance in &quot;[[Professor Chaos (South Park episode)|Professor Chaos]]&quot;, where he was one of twenty candidates to replace the then-deceased Kenny in the boys' group.
