  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Scott Stadium]] sits across from the first-year dorms along Alderman Road and is home to the University of Virginia's football program. The press box at [[Scott Stadium]] was a gift from an alumni in honor of Norton G. Pritchett, the admired athletic director at [[University of Virginia|UVA]] from 1934 until his death in 1950. Students, fans, and alumni have recently begun to sport orange clothing for the games, a new tradition the current head coach, [[Al Groh]], has been pushing for since he became head coach in 2000. Many students, however, have continued to wear the traditional sundresses or coat and tie at football games. Several fans have also begun garbing themselves in outlandish costumes in the style of football superfans (such as the Orange Gorilla or The Superhoo). Funding from benefactor Carl Smith created the foundation for the 230-piece [[Cavalier Marching Band]] in 2004, replacing the [[Virginia Pep Band]] in its official capacity at athletic events.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
