  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Faye takes a job as PA at Sharma and Sharma, the new sweet factory in the village, and has a brief relationship with [[Cain Dingle]]. This ends, however, when Cain realises that Faye is using him to make Mark jealous. Mark realises that he still has feelings for Faye and tells her that he wants her back. She agrees, on condition that he leaves Natasha and tells him that she is not prepared to be his bit on the side. They plan to run away together but realising the pain they will cause, change their minds and share a goodbye kiss, which Natasha witnesses. The three of them have a row, during which Ryan comes downstairs with Mark and Natasha's daughter [[Maisie Wylde|Maisie]] and announce that they are dating. Natasha tells them that they cannot date each other because they are half-brother and sister, devastating Ryan and Maisie. Ryan is angry with Mark and Faye for lying to him and moves in with ex-girlfriend, [[Katie Sugden]], until he can organise somewhere else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
