  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tom's wedding day didn't get off to the best start when a furious [[Terry Woods (Emmerdale)|Terry Woods]] chased Tom's limo down the village's main street and proceeded to drag the groom out of the limo and punch him right outside the church.  Tom's sons Jimmy and Matthew made one final attempt to get Tom to call off the wedding, but were unsuccessful.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The brawl spilled out into the reception during the bride and groom's first dance, which Tom had to break up.  While Tom was giving his wedding present to Rosemary, [[Chas Dingle]] arrived, uninvited, and revealed that Tom had paid her to end her relationship with Carl before she was removed.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Meanwhile, Tom's enemies [[Bob Hope (Emmerdale)|Bob]] and [[Jamie Hope]] sneaked into the house.  While separated, Bob encountered Tom and was about to hit him with a vase but couldn't, and left to find Jamie.  While the firework show was going on, the housekeeper, [[Pearl Ladderbanks]], went looking for Tom and heard an argument between Tom and someone else, but never found out who. Soon afterwards, Tom crashed through a window and fell to his death.  During the commotion, Jamie got away, but Bob was spotted by Jimmy and Matthew and caught and held until the police arrived, at which point Bob was arrested.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
