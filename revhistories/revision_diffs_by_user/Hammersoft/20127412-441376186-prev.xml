  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Edmonia Lewis paved the way for Native American artists to sculpt in mainstream traditions using non-Native materials. [[Allan Houser]] ([[Warms Springs Chiricahua Apache]]) became one of most prominent Native sculptors of the 20th century. Though he worked in wood and stone, Houser is most known for his monumental bronze sculptors, both representational and abstract. Houser influenced a generation of Native sculptors by teaching at the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]]. His two sons, Phillip and [[Bob Haozous]] are sculptors today. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] ([[Santa Clara Pueblo]]) is known for her expressive, figurative, ceramic sculptures but has also branched into bronze casting, and her work is permanently displayed at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Northwest Coastal tribes are known for their woodcarving â most famously their monumental [[totem pole]]s that display clan crests. During the 19th century and early 20th century, this art form was threatened but was effectively revived. [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] totem pole carvers such as Charlie James, [[Mungo Martin]], [[Ellen Neel]], and [[Willie Seaweed]] kept the art alive and also carved masks, furniture, bentwood boxes, and jewelry. Haida carvers include [[Charles Edenshaw]], [[Bill Reid]], and [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]]. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with [[Haida Argillite Carvings|argillite]]. Traditional formline designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as [[Preston Singletary]] ([[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]), Susan Point ([[Coast Salish]]) and Marvin Oliver ([[Quinault people|Quinault]]/[[Isleta Pueblo]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tall Chief, Russ.
