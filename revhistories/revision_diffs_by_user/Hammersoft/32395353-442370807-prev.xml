  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On television, Radar's character started off worldly and sneaky, a clerk who carried with him at all times a pocketful of passes for any potential scam that might arise. At one point, he tried to mail home a [[Jeep]], [[Salami slicing|piece by piece]]. (Hawkeye commented that once Radar's mailman found out, he'd have a retroactive [[hernia]].) He was known for his tremendous appetite for heaping portions of food. He was also not averse to drinking Col. Blake's brandy and smoking his cigars when the colonel was off-duty, and he occasionally drank the [[moonshine]] liquor that Hawkeye and McIntyre made in their [[Pot still|still]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Cigars and strong liquor made him ill or dizzy (despite him frequently drinking and smoking cigars previously), and despite numerous references to him losing his [[virginity]] in earlier episodes, he appeared to have regained it later in the series. His favorite beverage was [[Nehi]] Brand Grape Soda. In &quot;[[The Novocaine Mutiny]],&quot; it is revealed that Radar won $300 from Sgt. Zale in a poker game. A minor change was that he lost the ability to speak fluent Korean which should have been a blow to the camp as he was the only person who spoke it, even if in later episodes it was only a few halting sentences.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
