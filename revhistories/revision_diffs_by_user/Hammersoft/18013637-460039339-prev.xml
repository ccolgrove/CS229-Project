  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Taukei ni Waluvu'''  is the [[Fiji]]an picturesque phrase for &quot;Native of the Flood.&quot; It is the traditional chiefly title of the warrior hill clan Siko-Natabutale of Nairukuruku village. The history of the clan from the mid- nineteenth century, represent the  social structures of the chiefly system,religion and western culture that supported colonialism in  Fiji. Tradition,Christianity and British indirect rule were  combined to legitimize what was accepted as the right way to govern. Condemned by some modern day critics as exploitative, the Fijian chiefly system was the medium of native  social interdependence and a traditional contract shared by the indigenous clans of pre-colonial Fiji, that was justly utilized for colonial rule. Since Independence the chiefly system has had to adapt to the demands of modernity.  Anthropologist Arthur Capell in his study of early tribal migration within Fiji made the point that, &quot;the history of Fiji is the history of chiefly families.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;A.

The relationship between Chiefs and Westerners in especially Missionaries thus became a focal point for gathering insight into Fijian culture and tradition in the nineteenth century.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
