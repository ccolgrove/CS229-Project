  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate [[stereotype]] of [[yuppie]] greed: rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and [[conspicuous consumption]]. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another, and they often confuse him for other people. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his always designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, as well as his elaborate high end stereo and [[home cinema|home theater]] sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Williams. They can't stand each other, but they stay together for the sake of their social lives. He has a mistress on the side (the fiancee of a [[gay]] colleague whom he holds in great contempt and who makes repeated, hapless sexual advances towards Bateman) and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life he has anything approaching feelings for is his secretary, Jean. He just cannot bring himself to seduce, rape or kill her, perhaps because she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow. Every time he mentions Jean throughout the novel, he casually acknowledges her as &quot;Jean, my secretary who is in love with me&quot; and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he &quot;will probably end up married to someday&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

His friends mock him as the &quot;boy next door&quot;, his own lawyer refers to him as a &quot;bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody&quot;, and he is often dismissed as &quot;yuppie trash&quot; by people outside of his social circle. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he &quot;just wants to be loved&quot;. He takes [[psychotropic]]s, like [[Xanax]], to get these attacks under control.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
