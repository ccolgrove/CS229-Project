  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Olena Petrovich''' was introduced as an illegal immigrant character in [[Emmerdale]] in November 2009.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a182244/illegal-immigrant-plot-for-emmerdale.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She arrived in the village in the back of a haulage truck driven by [[Carl King]] and ran away, hiding in the Dingle's barn. She was found and befriended by [[Belle Dingle]] and [[List_of_minor_Emmerdale_characters_(2009)#Will Wylde|Will Wylde]]. She later became friends with [[Sam Dingle|Sam]] who tended to her injured leg and offered her shelter and protection as she explained she wanted to work to send money back to her young son in the [[Ukraine]]. When [[Zak Dingle|Zak]] and [[Lisa Dingle|Lisa]] eventually discovered her, she was welcomed into the Dingle homestead and Sam got her a job working at the B&amp;amp;B for [[Eric Pollard]]. Recently, however, she seems to have become uncomfortable at Sam's romantic advances. When &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List of residences in Emmerdale#Wishing Well Cottage|Wishing &lt;/span&gt;Well &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Cottage]] &lt;/span&gt;was destroyed, she moved in with [[Marlon Dingle|Marlon]], [[Eli Dingle|Eli]] and [[List_of_minor_Emmerdale_characters_(2009)#Lizzie Lakley|Lizzie]]. In early April, Sam proposed to Olena, which she said no to, because she is doesn't have a passport. Later, Sam goes to Cain and asks him to help him get a fake passport for Olena. Zak soon learns about it and tells Olena to leave Sam alone and that when she gets her fake passport he wants her to leave the village. She and Eli soon realise that they have feelings for each other and share a kiss. Sam invites Olena to the Dingles' party celebrating Lisa's release from prison, which she accepts, but doesn't want to. Zak goes round to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List of residences in Emmerdale#Tall Trees Cottage|Tall &lt;/span&gt;Trees &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Cottage]] &lt;/span&gt;and tells her to stay away. When Olena doesn't come, Sam goes to look for her, and spots her and Eli kissing. Sam is heartbroken. Later, the UK Border Control arrive after getting an anonymous tip-off that Terry and Eric are employing people illegally. Terry doesn't know how they are employing people illegally but says Olena is polish, which he believes. Olena admits to Terry that she is [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]], not [[Poles|Polish]] and doesn't have any papers. Olena is taken away by the Border Control and Sam later confesses to having reported her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
