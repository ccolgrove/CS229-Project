  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;DMC-CFI, then named Dipolog Medical Center School of Midwifery, began as an expansion program of Dipolog Medical Center Inc., a stock corporation which started operating on August 1, 1974 as a fifty-bed general hospital located in Sta. Filomena, Dipolog City. Dipolog Medical Center (DMC) is the realization of the ideas of fifteen Dipolog medical practitioners and Msgr. Felix Zafra, former bishop of Dipolog, pooling their expertise and resources together to establish a high-quality hospital facility in the city. It took more than two years for the institution to open a course of Midwifery, which began operating in 1977.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1989, after a series of financial setbacks, a new management team took over the helm of DMC within a year. The new management felt the need for exposing more young men and women of the cities of Dipolog and Dapitan and the neighboring municipalities to medical training and the medical profession. Through the efforts of Chairman of the Board Atty. Alberto P. Concha and Hospital Director Dr. Stephen Yap, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) curriculum was opened. The permit by the Bureau of Higher Education was granted on April 30, 1991, and the school began its first year level of BSN June of that year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
