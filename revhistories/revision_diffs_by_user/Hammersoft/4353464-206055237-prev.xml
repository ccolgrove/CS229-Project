  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''Giant Forest Hog''' (''Hylochoerus meinertzhageni'') is the largest wild member of the [[pig]] family [[Suidae]]. It is the only member of the genus '''''Hylochoerus'''''. Males can reach as much as 2 metres in length and 1.1 metres high at the shoulder and have been known to weigh as much as 1,100 pounds (500 kg); but such claims are often exaggeration and must be scrutinized. Unlike most species of wild suid, the giant forest hog has extensive hairs on its body, though these tend to become less pronounced as the animal ages. It is mostly black in colour on the surface, though hairs nearest the skin of the animal are a deep orange colour. Its ears are large and pointy, and its [[tusk]]s are much smaller than those of the [[warthog]] or [[bushpig]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
