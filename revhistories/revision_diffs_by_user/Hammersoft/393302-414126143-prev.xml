  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alsos is sometimes mistakenly written ''ALSOS'' by sources including the [[U.S. Army]], perhaps because it does not look like a usual English word and is thus falsely assumed to be an acronym. In fact, ''Alsos'' is the [[Hellenic]] name for &quot;[[wikt:grove|grove]]&quot;, and so this designation is a play on the name of Major General [[Leslie M. Groves]], the military director of the Manhattan Engineering District (the [[Manhattan Project]]), the Allied wartime effort to develop an atomic bomb (which itself was sparked out of fears of a German weapon). Groves was the major impetus behind the project, in part because of his desire to make sure that German technology and personnel did not fall into Soviet hands, so as to prolong the anticipated American monopoly on nuclear weapons as much as possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
