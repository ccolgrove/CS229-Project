The advocate-turned-littÃ©rateur Bandyopadhyay was deeply influenced by [[Sherlock Holmes]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://byomkesh.com/2010/01/17/byomkesh-v-sherlock/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Hercule Poirot]] of [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Father Brown]] of [[G.K.Chesterton]] as well as the &quot;tales of ratiocination&quot; involving [[C. Auguste Dupin]] produced by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He was, however, concerned with how the Indian and Bengali fictional detectives created between 1890 and 1930 had failed to exist as something other than mere copies of the Western (and particularly English) fictional detectives. The stories of Dinendra Kumar Ray's Robert Blake, Panchkari Dey's Debendra Bijoy Mitra or Swapan Kumar's Deepak Chatterjee  were almost always set in London or in Kolkata which was identifiably the British metropolis. It was almost as a postcolonial response that Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay introduced the Bengali 'bhadrolok' (gentleman) sleuth Byomkesh Bakshi and [[Ajit Bandyopadhyay]] (Byomkesh's associate and narrator) in &quot;Pather Kanta&quot; in 1932, and began to write of them as investigating in an Indian metropolisâthe capital of British India until 1911âthat has had been thoroughly Indianised. Initially serialized in the literary magazine Basumati, the stories and novels were all eventually published in hardcover editions, the first being [[Byomkesh-er Diary]]. In all, Sharadindu wrote 33 stories featuring Byomkesh, one of which remained incomplete due to his death. Byomkesh is one of the most popular characters in Bengali literature, along with [[Feluda]] of [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Kakababu]] of [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Ghanada]] of [[Premendra Mitra]] and [[Tenida]] of [[Narayan Gangopadhyay]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
