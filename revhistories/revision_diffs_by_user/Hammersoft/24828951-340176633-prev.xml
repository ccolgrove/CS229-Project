  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Flor flirts with Pablo shamelessly, leading him to believe that he has a chance with her, if he could only get Pedro out of the way. Flor is also Dona Rosaâs choice for Pedro. She offers Pedro advice as to how to court her. But, Flor continues to coyly sidestep his advances.  In desperation, Pedro publicly drops all his other girl friends by singing his farewell to them from horseback in the village square, singing that they will always remain as a &quot;butterfly in his soul&quot;. They all take it badly. Finally, after a series of misadventures, Pedro does win over Flor and she agrees to marry him. However, when Pablo hears of this development, he is outraged and swears that he is going to do something about it. LuciÃ©rnaga means &quot;firefly&quot; in Spanish. When Pedro goes to LuciÃ©rnaga to tell her that he cannot see her any more, she tells Pedro that she expects him to marry her. Pedro quickly ends his relationship with her. LuciÃ©rnaga tells him that &quot;fireflies also have stingers&quot; and swears to herself that he is going to pay. LuciÃ©rnaga goes to Pablo, who has just gotten word of Flor's engagement to Pedro, to ask him, as town mayor, to lock up Pedro for the shameful way he had treated her. At which point, he tells him that he has a better idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

When Dona Rosa asks Tucita tenderly what she is doing on her mare, Tucita says her mother told her that Dona Rosa was her âgrannyâ. Dona Rosa lovingly takes Tucita from the mare and takes her into the ranch house. She sets her down and gets Tucita to show her a letter she is carrying from Tucitaâs âmotherâ, which says that Tucita is Pedroâs daughter. The letter is signed âyour victimâ. The clincher is that Tucita has a photo of Pedro on a string around her neck. Dona Rosa needs little convincing. She strokes Tucitaâs hair lovingly and tells Tucita that she âalone is the victimâ.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the last scene of the movie, Pedro and Flor come out of the village cathedral after their marriage. However, even just married, Pedro pays too much attention to a passing beauty by exclaiming âVÃ¡lgame Dios (roughly translated &quot;Heaven Help Me!&quot;)â. Tucita then also exclaims from the wedding party âVÃ¡lgame Dios!â â showing one and all that despite her non-granddaughter status, she has not lost her place in Dona Rosaâs home or heart.  Dona Rosa then drags an unreformed Pedro off by the ear as the movie ends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
