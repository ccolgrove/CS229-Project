  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''[[fictional universe]]''' of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s '''''[[Harry Potter]]''''' series of fantasy novels comprises two separate and distinct societies: the '''wizarding world''' and the '''[[Muggle]] world'''. The Muggle world is the series' name for the world inhabited by the non-magical majority, with the wizarding world existing [[wikt:coextensive|coextensively]] with it but hidden from the awareness of the non-magical &quot;[[Muggle]]s&quot;. The plot of the series is set in contemporary [[Great Britain]], but in a veiled and separate shadow society in which [[Magic in Harry Potter|magic]] is real, and those who can use it live in enforced seclusion, hiding their talents from the real world. The term &quot;wizarding world&quot; refers to the global wizard community that lives hidden in parallel with the Muggle world; the different terms refer to different communities within the same area rather than separate [[planets]] or worlds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
