  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Diners attract a wide spectrum of the local populations, and are generally [[small business]]es. From the mid-Twentieth century onwards, they have been seen as quintessentially [[United States|American]], reflecting the perceived cultural diversity and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] nature of the country at large. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the days when diners were America's most widespread 24-hour public establishments, the fact that they were open all night meant they could also serve as symbols of loneliness and isolation. [[Edward Hopper|Edward Hopper's]] iconic 1942 painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'' depicts a diner and its occupants, late at night. The diner in the painting is based on a real location in [[Greenwich Village]], but was chosen in part because diners were anonymous slices of Americana, meaning that the scene could have been taken from any city in the country-and also because a diner was a place to  which isolated individuals, awake long after bedtime, would naturally be drawn. The spread of the diner meant that by 1942 it was possible for Hopper to cast this institution in a role for which, fifteen years earlier, he had used an [[Automat (painting)|Automat]] all-night restaurant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
