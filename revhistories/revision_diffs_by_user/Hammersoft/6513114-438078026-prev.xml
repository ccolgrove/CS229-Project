  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The most notable Marvel story addressing the issue of World War III was in Uncanny X-Men #150. In it, the villain Magneto once again threatens the world, with the threat of using his newly increased magnetic powers to cause unspeakable destruction across the globe unless all of the governments of the world cede control over the planet to him. Magneto, when confronted by the X-Men, defends his murderous actions (which includes destroying an entire Russian city and sinking a Soviet nuclear submarine) by stating that if he not take over the world then and there, that mutantkind would be destroyed along with mankind in the event of a nuclear war. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
