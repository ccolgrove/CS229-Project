  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Following the principles set forth by the [[Federal Housing Administration|FHA]] and responding to the need for affordable housing, Mace developed several neighborhoods in Arlington County in the early twentieth century which provided economical housing to the growing population. Mace, who lived in Arlington County, was a real estate broker&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;According to the 1930 United States Census, Mace lived on Glebe Road with his wife, father, mother, and mother-in-law&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;.  He was just twenty-six years old when he began to play a role in developing the community of Over-Lee Knollsâadjacent to Westover to the northwest and today considered part of greater Westover.  The Over-Lee Knolls neighborhood was advertised in 1926 as âVirginiaâs Ideal Suburbâ which emphasized value and quality construction&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Washington Post, 10 October 1926&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
