  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Samantha, usually referred to as Sam, has long, wavy red hair, and a green catsuit. She is the most intelligent of the group and is often considered the de-facto leader. She uses her intelligence to create plans and diversions so that the girls can easily capture the villains. Sam also acts as the big sister to the group and keeps the girls in line, but sometimes she will have her moments where she is not as focused as she should be.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Clover has medium length blonde hair, blue eyes and a red catsuit. She is considered to be the show's most stereotypical character: she is always more concerned about her looks, boys, and the latest trends and fads than she is about her work as a spy.  As a result, she is often side-tracked on the missions.  In fact, her priority focus on her social life has even sometimes affected the entire team's performance.  In the episode &quot;''Super Agent Much?''&quot;, she was seen talking away on her cell phone while the spies were chasing a villain, resulting in the villain being able to escape. She has also blown the girl's cover multiple times. In the episode &quot;''Spies on the Farm''&quot;, she jumped out blowing their cover because the farmer had turned his two cute sons part human, part vegetables.  She often compares fashion to her work and is usually more concerned with trying to improve her social life and become more popular in different ways.  She is normally (if not always) the first one to go against Mandy.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She loves to play sports especially soccer and is always trying out some new fad diet. Alex is also the most naive. She sometimes is bit slow to some of the figures of speeches and takes them too literally. She is also the most childish seeing as her best friend is toy turtle named Olie. In the episode ''Futureshock'' it was revealed that she still has it even though she is in her thirties and keeps it under her pillow,  She sometimes makes bad grades in school but eventually pulls it out in the end. Another characteristic of Alex is that she is always about keeping her friends happy. She often serves as a link between Clover and Sam who sometimes have meaningless squabbles (like one happening for a petty reason between Sam and Clover in season 1 episode &quot;''Abductions''&quot;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
