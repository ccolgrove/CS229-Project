Although he pursues his objective valiantly, and in fact is able to ultimately slay Saturos and Menardi in a climactic confrontation atop the aerie of Venus Lighthouse, two of the Elemental Lighthouses are nonetheless activated, and he must now continue pursuing the remaining members of Saturos' group - his former friend [[#Felix|Felix]] and the Water Adept Alex - who continue their quest in Saturos' stead. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Prior to the first ''Golden Sun'', the Wise One has laid dormant within Mt. Aleph's Sol Sanctum, in the chamber containing the four Elemental Star jewels needed to activate the four Elemental Lighthouses and thus restore the force of Alchemy to the world of Weyard. In the present, when an off-limits investigation into Sol Sanctum conducted by [[#Kraden|Kraden]] and [[#Isaac|Isaac]] coincides with a raid of Mt.Aleph by [[#Saturos and Menardi|Saturos]]â band, Saturos and Menardi are able to pilfer three of the Stars before the Wise One appears and they must flee. Isaac, holding the fourth Star (the Mars Star), is instructed by the Wise One to set out on a quest in pursuit of Saturos' group and prevent them from accomplishing their objective of restoring Alchemy to the world, which the Wise One explains is a dangerous power if abused and thus should be kept sealed. The Wise One sets up the scenario of Isaac and his friends that takes place throughout ''Golden Sun'' and much of ''The Lost Age''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

So Felix's group is pursued by Isaac's group in much the same way throughout much of ''The Lost Age'', but after a dramatic series of events at Jupiter Lighthouse that causes its eventual activation as well, Felix is able to convey to Isaac the reason why Alchemy must be returned: it is the lifeblood of the world, and without it the world will eventually erode away. Isaac joins forces with Felix and heads to the last Lighthouse to activate it against the Wise One's command.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
