  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In baseball, a beanball is a pitch, similar to a [[brushback pitch]] but actually intended to [[Hit by pitch|hit the batter]] as it is thrown at the head. It is rarely used as a strategic weapon, and is usually an act of anger and frustration; however, batters facing known headhunters are given a reason to fear a beanball and may alter their approach to hitting in the interests of self protection, perhaps giving some strategic advantage to the pitcher. Some pitchers have been known to throw beanballs in response to giving up [[home run]]s. Teams with rivalries often find several beanballs exchanged a season. Beanballs can sometimes lead to fights, [[charging the mound]], and [[bench-clearing brawl]]s. Because of the hazards of the pitch and the possibility of fights, [[Umpire (baseball)|umpires]] will now often warn teams, after beanballs or fights have occurred, that any pitcher who throws at a batter will be ejected from the game with a mandatory one day suspension for the pitcher's manager. Throwing at batters can sometimes lead to suspension for a number of games as well. Managers may also be ejected, if in the umpire's judgment, they ordered their pitcher to throw a beanball.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several players' careers have been impaired or derailed after being struck with a beanball.  [[Hall of Famer]] [[Mickey Cochrane]] was knocked unconscious for ten days in 1937, and never played another game. In 1941, Dodgers outfielder [[Pete Reiser]] was hospitalized for a month, one of numerous injuries which shortened his career. [[Lou Boudreau]] played only sporadically after being beaned in 1951, and retired the following season. [[Tony Conigliaro]] missed over a year after being hit in the eye, and his vision later deteriorated. [[Dickie Thon]] returned from a gruesome beaning in 1984, but never matched his earlier success. On September 28, 1995, [[Kirby Puckett]], the superstar outfielder of the Minnesota Twins, was struck in the cheek by a Dennis MartÃ­nez  fastball, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be his last game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career. In 2005, the Cubs' [[Adam Greenberg (baseball)|Adam Greenberg]] was hit in the head with the first, and thus far, the only pitch that he faced in his major league career. [[Ron Santo]], who thought he'd lost an eye when his cheekbone was broken by a pitch in 1966, rushed back to the lineup.  He described his attitude: &quot;It was like, 'Here, hit me again.' I didn't have any fear. I just went on. When you get older, maybe fear does set in. Nobody will admit that, but it does happen.&quot; [[Don Zimmer]], who was nearly killed by a beanball in 1953 and had four metal buttons surgically implanted in his skull, recounted, &quot;It's not a case of being tougher than anybody else... You never know how you're going to react until you come back and play again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
