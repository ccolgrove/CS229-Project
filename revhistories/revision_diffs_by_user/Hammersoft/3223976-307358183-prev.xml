  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A mysterious [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[scientist]]. Sometimes solves extremely complex problems for Dilbert. When Mother Nature had a [[deer]] shoot Dilbert with a bow and arrow, he saved Dilbert's life by repairing a cloning device that Dilbert had thrown out. In the TV show, it was revealed that he was the only [[waste collector|garbageman]] in the entire city, and was able to accomplish this by traveling from house to house instantaneously with [[wormhole]]s. The World's Smartest Garbageman owns a working [[Phaser (fictional weapon)|phaser]], a &quot;chaos driven weather control device&quot;, and an &quot;anti-stupidity gun&quot; which destroys the stupid part of a person while leaving the rest intact. Dilbert borrows the anti-stupidity gun in one strip, and uses it on the pointy haired boss. However, the result of this was that only the PHB's empty suit and signiture pointy hair survived. Dogbert borrows the phaser in another strip because Dilbert refuses to make one for him. Dogbert uses it to zap stupid people for a couple of strips, then returns it. After the Garbageman asks him if he used it in anger, Dogbert replies that he was wagging the entire time and probably wouldn't stop for a couple days. In one particular strip, the Garbageman completes an almost-fully operational robot Dilbert throws out, and sends it to harass him. Adams claims that the irony of a genius working as a garbage man is that we really have no right to question his choice of careers as we are not as smart as he is. In fact, when asked by Dilbert about why is he a garbageman, he replies by saying the most adequate question would be why is Dilbert an [[engineer]].  Further displaying his electronic talents he and Dogbert invented dial-up [[Internet]], to see &quot;how long people would sit in front of a screen waiting for a barely recognizable blotch&quot;, taking no credit for the feat, &quot;blaming it on [[Vinton Cerf|a drunken college student]]&quot;, who was seen later with people bringing him baskets full of money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
