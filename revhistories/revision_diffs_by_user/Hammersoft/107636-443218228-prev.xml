  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Running parallel to The Strand is a lovely linear trail known today as the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt.  Once part of a railroad easement, this narrow {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} strip had long been the subject of heated controversy and pressure from various commercial interests.  After years of litigation and wrangling, the city was poised to permit intensive retail and condominium development in the mid-1980s when a grassroots group spearheaded by activist Rosamond Fogg forced the matter to a vote.  The City Council at the time was divided over whether the matter was of much importance but after an energetic and passionate campaign, the citizens found that the greenbelt was a vital recreational resource and mandated its preservation for the use and enjoyment of residents and visitors.  This ballot initiative passed by almost 87%, the highest in California history.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The public also substantiated this effort by taxing themselves millions of dollars in order to purchase the lands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  As a result, the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt has the quality of a rural country lane, home to butterflies and many bird and animal species.  At any time of day or night joggers and walkers enjoy its soft woodchip trails and graceful landscaping.  The Greenbelt is also now part of the Federal [[Rails to Trails]] network.  RUDAT (an urban architectural planning group) found that Hermosa Beach, thanks in large part to the existence of the Greenbelt, was a &quot;world class pedestrian city&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
