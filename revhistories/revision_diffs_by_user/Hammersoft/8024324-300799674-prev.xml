  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Amanda was a heroin addict who John met at a hospital, and subsequently became one of his first victims. She survived her test and proceeded to become Jigsaw's apprentice. Amanda started to create her own games and traps once Jigsaw became too ill to work. These games included: Detective Matthews test, the Classroom Trap, the Angel Trap, and the Shotgun Collar. The last three were designed to be inescapable, killing the players even if they succeeded in doing what was asked of them. This was due to Amanda's view that nobody changed even if they survived the traps and would simply go back to abusing their lives. She was later shot in the neck and killed by Jeff Reinhart after she shot his wife, Lynn. Amanda's corpse was shown again in ''[[Saw IV]]'' and ''[[Saw V]]''. [[Shawnee Smith]] is set to reprise her role as [[Amanda Young]] in ''[[Saw VI]]''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;John Kramer was a vigilante, afflicted with terminal cancer, who built and created traps (which he referred to as games) for victims whom he believed took their lives for granted. After the death of his unborn child and learning of his inoperable frontal lobe tumor, he tried to kill himself by driving off a cliff, but survived. From then on, using his knowledge of engineering, John went on to create devices to test a victim's will to live. He abducted people whom he believed didn't appreciate life and caused them to undergo tests that in some way reflected what he perceived to be their flaws (such as drugs, lies, apathy, negligence, obsession, etc.), and if they passed their test, they would be free to go. He marked his failed test subjects by removing a piece of skin in the shape of a jigsaw piece, from which police coined his alias, Jigsaw (although John dislikes this name). It is later learned that he gained an apprentice in Amanda Young, one of his only surviving players. John was killed by Jeff Reinhart with a circular saw at the end of the third movie. With Amanda being shot and killed by Jeff in ''[[Saw III]]'', it is soon learned that he had another apprentice, who was revealed as Mark Hoffman in ''[[Saw IV]]''. During John's autopsy, a tape found in his stomach proved to contain a message for Hoffman that the games will continue despite John's death and Hoffman himself will be tested. Jigsaw appears in ''Saw V'', in a series of flashbacks that depict his recruitment of Hoffman after he blackmailed him to be an accomplice. Tobin Bell is set to reprise his role as Jigsaw in ''Saw VI''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adam appeared in ''Saw'' as a photographer hired and paid by the discharged Detective David Tapp to follow Lawrence Gordon and take pictures of him. He was targeted and kidnapped by the Jigsaw killer for &quot;being a voyeur&quot; of other peoples lives without indulging in his own. Adam was placed into a game of Jigsaw's, alongside Lawrence. The two of them were chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of a grimy bathroom and given conflicting goals; Lawrence was told to kill Adam by 6:00 in order to save his family, while Adam had to find some way to stay alive. Adam had been initially placed unconscious in a bathtub full of water along with the key to his shackle, which would have allowed him to escape without harm. However, he panicked upon waking up and kicked the stopper loose, causing the key to be sucked down the drain. Adam killed Zep Hindle, whom he thought was Jigsaw, only to discover that the seemingly dead man in the middle of the bathroom floor was alive and the real mastermind behind the events that had happened. He ultimately failed his &quot;test&quot; and was left to die in the trap alone. In ''[[Saw III]]'', it is revealed that Jigsaw's apprentice, Amanda Young, returned to the bathroom and suffocated Adam to death to end his suffering. According to the original script, the key was not meant to go down the drain, or at least not right away; Amanda had tied the stopper to Adam's ankle, something she had not been instructed to do. Adam's last name was originally shown as &quot;Faulkner&quot;, however, in ''Saw V'', his last name is listed as Stanheight, so Faulkner may be his middle name. Because of this, Adam's surname is not completely clear.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In the beginning it was revealed she is the Vice President of a real estate company. From the very beginning she and fellow victim, Mallick, worked together to analyze the traps. She took all five keys from the first room just in case they were needed later in the game, and discovered that one key would have fit all the locks on the collars she and the others were wearing. In the second room she was the first one to receive a key and was not involved in Charlesâs death. In the third room she killed Luba, saying she had never trusted her. She then used Lubaâs body to connect the several wires together in order to open the door to the next room. In the final room, she realized that a building fire which had killed eight people connected the five victims of these games; she had initiated a plan to burn the building down, knowing that it was not abandoned. In addition, she determined that all five victims could have survived every trap up to this point by working together, rather than allowing one person to die in each room. She, however, worked with Mallick to fill a beaker with the required amount of blood to open the exit from the game. She managed to crawl out of the room. Dan Erickson found her as she fell unconscious, saying &quot;we won, we worked together&quot;. Erickson then called for medical assistance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Daniel appeared in ''[[Saw II]]'' as the son of [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]. During a visitation with his father, Daniel got caught shoplifting which sparked an argument with his father. After suggesting he go back to his mother's early, Daniel was told to just leave and went missing. As Eric Matthews uncovered Jigsaw's lair, he discovered that his son had been taken prisoner and placed in a house full of nerve gas, along with seven other people. The seven others were all arrested at one point or another by Eric, but only after having evidence planted against them by the detective. He assisted Laura in getting from room to room, and spoke with Amanda about how to survive as well as helping her get out of a pit of syringes. After heading off with the three females, Daniel realized that his father had set up the others in the house. After Laura died, Addison and Amanda turned their backs on Daniel, knowing he was the corrupt detective's son, despite his protests that he didn't know. At that point, Xavier started his rampage through the house looking for the numbers on the back of everyone's neck which provided the combination to a safe which had an antidote inside (Daniel's number was never revealed, however). Amanda, seeing that Jonas had been murdered, turned back and grabbed Daniel to help him. She led him into the foundation of the house, while Xavier followed close behind. As Daniel weakened, Amanda helped him to keep moving, eventually ending up in the bathroom trap from the [[Saw (film)|first movie]]. Daniel appeared to pass out on the floor, leading Amanda to believe he had succumbed to the nerve gas. However, he sprung to life when Xavier reached for him, killing him by slicing his neck with a hacksaw, in the process saving himself and Amanda. After surviving for so long in the Nerve Gas House, he was administered an antidote by Amanda. She brought him to Jigsaw's lair to be locked in a safe with an oxygen pump, as part of Eric's test. The safe later opened up, revealing to Detective Allison Kerry and the rest of the SWAT team that he was alive. Daniel appeared briefly in Saw V lying unconscious when Jigsaw and Mark Hoffman were setting up the house trap. According to the ''Saw II'' website, Daniel was written to be 17 years old.&amp;lt;ref name=OfficialSawII/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Daniel appeared in ''[[Saw II]]'' as the son of [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]. During a visitation with his father, Daniel got caught shoplifting which sparked an argument with his father. After suggesting he go back to his mother's early, Daniel was told to just leave and went missing. As Eric Matthews uncovered Jigsaw's lair, he discovered that his son had been taken prisoner and placed in a house full of nerve gas, along with seven other people. The seven others were all arrested at one point or another by Eric, but only after having evidence planted against them by the detective. He assisted Laura in getting from room to room, and spoke with Amanda about how to survive as well as helping her get out of a pit of syringes.

Lawrence woke up, chained by his ankle to a pipe inside an industrial bathroom along with [[List_of_Saw_characters#Adam Faulkner/Stanheight|Adam Faulkner]].

Charles noticed burn marks on his arms and asked if he had been playing with fire again. Ignoring both the others and the warning from Jigsaw, he rushed to get the key to let himself out of the neck trap; this action set off a one-minute countdown until everyone still wearing a collar would be decapitated. He made it out of the room. In the second room, he quickly tried to find a key to a safe area. However, Charles attacked him, knocking him to the floor, and took a key from him. Luba then knocked Charles over the head with one of the sticks used to break the jars, then gave the key back to Mallick so he could survive the impending explosion in that room. In the next room, Luba knocked Mallick into the tub in order to use his body as the electrical conductor to open a door. However, Brit fatally stabbed Luba in the neck, and she and Mallick completed the lock circuits using her corpse. Once all the cables were connected, the electrical current was enough to trigger the door to open where their final test would be held.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
