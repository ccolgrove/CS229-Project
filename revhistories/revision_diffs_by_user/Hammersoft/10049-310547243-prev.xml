  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Clapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast to his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction. In addition to his (temporarily) unrequited and intense attraction to [[Pattie Boyd]], he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey, England residence. There he nursed his [[Substance abuse|heroin addiction]], resulting in a career hiatus interrupted only by the [[Concert for Bangladesh]] in August 1971 (where he passed out on stage, was revived, and continued the show).&amp;lt;ref name = &quot;iqixjy&quot;/&amp;gt; In January 1973, [[The Who]]'s Pete Townshend organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]] aptly titled the &quot;[[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]]&quot; to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton would return the favour by playing 'The Preacher' in [[Tommy (film)|Ken Russell's film version]] of The Who's ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' in 1975; his appearance in the film (performing &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;) is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the movie and leave the set.&amp;lt;ref name = &quot;nxfddy&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
