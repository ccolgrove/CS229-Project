He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new Borg attack against Earth. Picard's orders are for his ship, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]], to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of [[Romulan]] aggression, as Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight. Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the ''Enterprise'' crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. The ''Enterprise'' arrives in time to save the crew of the [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']] and its captain, Lieutenant Commander [[Worf]]. Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;nemecek-326&quot;&amp;gt;Nemecek, 326.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet.
