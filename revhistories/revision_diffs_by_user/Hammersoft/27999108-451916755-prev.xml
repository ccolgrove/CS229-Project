  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Prior to the Dark Days war, District 13 worked in [[nuclear technology]] and mined [[graphite]].  During the Dark Days they were one of the major forces of the rebellion.  Near the end of the Dark Days they managed to take control of the nuclear arsenal. District 13 was supposedly bombed and destroyed before the first annual Hunger Games at the end of the Dark Days war, but it is hinted in ''Catching Fire'' that they might have survived, and it is confirmed in ''Mockingjay'' that they literaly became an underground district when the population retreated to bunkers. The Capitol has spread the story that District 13 was destroyed after the Capitol and District 13 agreed to leave each other alone since the two were capable of [[mutually assured destruction]]. As part of their truce, District 13 has been at work for centuries to expand their underground bunkers to make room for the population of the Capitol, should it ever fall. Also, this underground district has its own farmsâeven a perfectly replicated meadowâthat they survive on after the Capitol destroyed everything above ground so as not to arouse suspicion. This was something that, according to Katniss, that Capitol had underestimated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
