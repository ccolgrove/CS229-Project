This version of Cyclops is very similar to the comic book version. While he is generally stiff, he has expressed doubts to his own leadership from time to time. His love is Jean Grey, who he eventually marries towards the end of the series. Cyclops is shown to be in his late twenties.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]''' (voiced by Iona Morris then Alison-Sealy Smith) - Storm's origins are very true to the comics. She was orphaned at an early age and spent her childhood living on the streets, often stealing in order to survive. Early in the series, Storm defeats Calisto to become the leader of the Morlocks, a position she later gives back to Calisto. Like her comic counterpart, Storm is claustrophobic. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
