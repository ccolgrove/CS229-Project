  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At 17h30 [[UTC]] on June 18, [[Al-Arabiya]] and [[CNN]] reported that Johnson had been [[Decapitation|beheaded]].  This report is based on three photographs of the [[murder]] posted on the [[Internet]].  Saudi officials initially claimed to have discovered Johnson's body near [[Riyadh]] later that day, but on June 19 those claims were withdrawn.  The Saudi government withheld official proclamation of Johnson's death until the body was found.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the execution video, after making the statements, the next shot is the beheading already in progress.  He is lying on a bed with what appear to be three men holding him down as one militant severs his head. Unlike the [[Nick Berg]] and [[Eugene Armstrong]] videos, there is no screaming.  The video was also similar to that of [[Daniel Pearl]], who was killed in [[Pakistan]] in 2002, and [[Kim Sun-il]], a [[South Korea]]n who was killed in Iraq during the same month not long after Johnson was killed in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
