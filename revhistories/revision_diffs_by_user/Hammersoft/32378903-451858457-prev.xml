Buckman with one product that was used to control microbiological problems in paper mills. Three years later in 1948, Buckman Laboratories of Canada was established as a warehouse and marketing company. During the 1950s, the company developed a number of biocides for use in the leather, sugar, and paint industries. Two new fungicides were developed in the 1960s.  During this decade, commercial and industrial water treatment became a new market with the development of products for bacterial and algae control in swimming pools, cooling water systems, and fresh water. In addition to the Memphis plant, a new manufacturing facility was built in Cadet, MO, in 1963.  Looking beyond Canada and the U.S., Buckman also formed a company in Mexico in 1963 and a year later a firm was established in Belgium, which served as the European headquarters.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
