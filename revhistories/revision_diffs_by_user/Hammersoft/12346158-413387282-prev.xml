  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Smosh began when Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla made videos together lip syncing to theme songs such as [[Mortal Kombat]], [[Power Rangers]], and [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. At first, these videos weren't intended to be posted online, but after they sent them to their friends, they soon decided to start a [[Youtube]] channel. Each created two channels: &quot;IanH&quot; and &quot;smosh.&quot; Ultimately, they decided on using smosh as their main channel, with &quot;IanH&quot; serving as an alternate channel that would feature behind the scenes material, vlogs, etc. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Although, their friend who goes by &quot;cherrioattack&quot; on [[YouTube]] is the one who started Anthony and Ian's thriving career, &quot;cherrioattack&quot; still refuses to be in any of their videos, as he does not like being the &quot;center of attention&quot;. &quot;Cherrioattack&quot; says he would describe himself as an [[introvert]] , rather than an [[extrovert]] .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
