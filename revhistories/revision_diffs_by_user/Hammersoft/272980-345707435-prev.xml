  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[The Masked Rider]] is Texas Tech University's oldest &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;mascot. &lt;/span&gt;The tradition began in 1936, when &quot;ghost riders&quot; were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the [[Gator Bowl]]. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' who witnessed the event, later wrote, &quot;No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Smits|first=Garry|title=Mascots unmasked: A lasting tradition for Texas Tech began at 1954 Gator Bowl|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=2007-12-26|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122507/col_228878061.shtml|accessdate=2006-04-30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Ritz|first=Jennifer|title=History of Masked Rider: A history of one of Texas Tech's Oldest and Best-Loved Traditions|work=Texas Techsan Magazine|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/spiritsquads/MR_History.htm|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion.
