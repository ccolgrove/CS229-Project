  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;{{quotation|Dear Mrs. Budd. In 1894 a friend of mine shipped as a deck hand on the Steamer Tacoma, Capt. John Davis. They sailed from [[San Francisco]] for [[Hong Kong]], [[China]]. On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk. When they returned the boat was gone. At that time there was [[famine]] in China. Meat of any kind was from $1â3 per pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop and ask for steakâchopsâor stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girl's behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as [[veal]] cutlet brought the highest price. John staid [sic] there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys, one 7 and one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet. Then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them&amp;amp;nbsp;â [[torture]]d them&amp;amp;nbsp;â to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11&amp;amp;nbsp;year old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except the headâbones and guts. He was roasted in the oven (all of his ass), boiled, broiled, fried and stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time, I was living at 409 E 100 St. nearâright side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3, 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheeseâstrawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her. On the pretense of taking her to a party. You said yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wildflowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down the stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mamma. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick&amp;amp;nbsp;â bite and scratch. I choked her to death, then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms. Cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me 9&amp;amp;nbsp;days to eat her entire body. I did fuck her tho [sic]&amp;lt;!-- Please don't correct his original spelling errors--&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Just before &lt;/span&gt;I &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;chopped her up tho [sic] &lt;/span&gt;I &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;stuck my raging boner into her small vagina and had sex with her. &lt;/span&gt;She died a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Virgin.
