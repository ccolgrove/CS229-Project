  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On 28th November, 2007, ''The Tribune Democrat'' reported that the shared news department of [[Fox Network|Fox]] affiliate [[WWCP-TV]] and ABC affiliate [[WATM-TV]] was going to shut down. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.tribune-democrat.com/local/local_story_332113055.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Under that operation, WWCP had produced an hour-long 10 p.m. news starting in 1992. However, according to a written statement, WWCP and WATM had been operating at a loss for years and the move was needed. The closure resulted in all personalities being released from their contracts. WJAC had on-air positions open but no personnel from those two stations were hired. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Effective 14th January, 2008, WJAC assumed production responsibility of the 10 o'clock broadcast on WWCP (still known as ''Fox 8 News at 10'') which was reduced to 35 minutes on weeknights and thirty minutes on weekends. The WJAC-produced news uses the same music package and some voice-overs seen during segment opens as the former operation had. A new graphics package slightly different from WJAC and new logos similar to the WWCP promo logo introduced in 2007 were created specifically for the primetime broadcast. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
