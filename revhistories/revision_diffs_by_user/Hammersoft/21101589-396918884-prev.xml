  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is currently the top rivalry for both teams. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;However the Steelers have won more games against the ravens and have won 6 times as many Super Bowls as them. (It should obviously be noted that the Steelers franchise has existed since 1933. The Ravens have been in Baltimore since 1996). &lt;/span&gt;In Baltimore, it has the added element of a small number of former Colts fans in the area becoming [[Steeler Nation|Steeler fans]] after the Colts moved, then retaining their affiliation with the Steelers after the Ravens moved to Baltimore and assumed the [[Cleveland Browns]]' spot in the [[AFC North|AFC Central]] with the Steelers. In [[Pittsburgh]], it is considered the [[spiritual successor]] to the [[BrownsâSteelers rivalry]] due to the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]] as well as the &quot;reactivated&quot; [[Cleveland Browns]] having a 4-19 record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Ravens&quot;&amp;gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs2008/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&amp;amp;page=HotRead18/Ravens-Steelers&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Due to its physical nature, it has received comparisons to the rivalry the Steelers had with the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the 1970's, when those two teams were among the most physical teams in the league.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09016/942193-66.stm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The two teams are so similar in style that they have received comparisons to each other in a similar matter to that of the [[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]] episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.steelerstoday.com/?p=7082 It's Ravens week|Steelers Today - A Pittsburgh Steelers Blog]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the Steelers introduced their [[throwback uniform]] as their [[third jersey|alternate uniform]] in 2007, they have used one of their two annual allotted games with the uniform against the Ravens at home each year, signifying the significance of the rivalry. The Ravens have typically worn their regular uniforms at home against the Steelers instead of their all-black third uniform. The only exception since then has been the team's meeting for the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] in 2008, when the Steelers elected to wear their standard home uniforms even though they would've been allowed by NFL rules to wear the throwbacks in all postseason games except the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
