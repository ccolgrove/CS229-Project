  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tracey Emin was born in [[Croydon]] and brought up in [[Margate]]. She has a twin brother. Emin's father, a [[Turkish Cypriot]], was married to a woman other than her mother and divided his time between his two families. He owned the Hotel International in Margate, and, when the business failed, Emin's family suffered a severe decline in their standard of living, circumstances which have featured in a number of works. Around the age of 13 she was raped. In a &quot;loosely autobiographical&quot; film to be made of this event she only asked, in true documentary fashion, that &quot;The extras will all come from Margate and I'll hire a church hall there to hold auditions. I'll ask each of the girls: 'What is it you really hate about your mum?'.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
