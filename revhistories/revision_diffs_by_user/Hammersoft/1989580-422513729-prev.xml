  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;French colonization in Louisiana left a cultural inheritance which has been celebrated significantly in recent decades. The heritage of the [[French language]], [[Louisiana Creole French]] and of [[Cajun French]] is that which has been most threatened; for this reason, the [[CODOFIL]] (Council for the Development of French in Louisiana) was created in 1968. A subject of debate is the variety of French that should be taught: that of France, [[Canadian French]], standard Louisiana French or Cajun French. Today, many Cajun-dominated areas of Louisiana have formed associations with [[Acadian]] communities in Canada, which send French professors to re-teach the language in the schools. In 2003, 7% of Louisianans were French-speaking, though most also spoke English. An estimated 25% of the state's population has some French ancestry, carrying a number of last names of French origin (e.g., LeBlanc, Cordier, Dion, Menard, Pineaux, HÃ©bert, Ardoin, Roubideauxâ¦).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
