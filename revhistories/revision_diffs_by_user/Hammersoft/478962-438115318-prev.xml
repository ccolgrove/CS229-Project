  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sustainable seafood is a movement that has gained momentum as more people become aware about overfishing and environmentally [[Environmental effects of fishing|destructive fishing methods]]. Sustainable seafood is [[seafood]] from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the [[ecosystem]]s from which it was acquired. In general, slow-growing fish that reproduce late in life, such as orange roughy, are vulnerable to overfishing.  Seafood species that grow quickly and breed young, such as anchovies and sardines, are much more resistant to overfishing. Several organizations, including the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC), and [[Friend of the Sea]], certify seafood fisheries as sustainable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
