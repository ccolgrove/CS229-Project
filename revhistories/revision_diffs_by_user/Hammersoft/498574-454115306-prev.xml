Despite the dire predictions of the doctors he &lt;/span&gt;made a full &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;recovery. &lt;/span&gt;He spent the first years of his life on his father's cattle ranch which consisted of 12,000 [[hectare]]s (25,000 [[acres]]) of forest, hills and savannah. On the ranch his companions were the sons of the ranch workers, small black boys with the same interests and preoccupations as Wilbur Smith.  With his companions he ranged through the bush, hiking, hunting, and trapping birds and small mammals. His mother read to him every night and later gave him novels of escape and excitement, which piqued his interest in fiction; however, his father dissuaded him from pursuing writing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

While in Natal he continued to be an avid reader and had the good fortune to have had a wonderful English master who made Wilbur Smith his protege, and would discuss the books Wilbur had read that week. Unlike Wilbur's father and many others, the English master made it clear to Wilbur that being a bookworm was praiseworthy, rather than something to be ashamed of and let Wilbur know that his writings showed great promise.  He tutored Wilbur on how to achieve dramatic effects, to develop characters and to keep a story moving forward. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

He points out that in his novel &quot;The Burning Shore&quot; the leading character, Centaine de Thiry, is a strong and highly intelligent woman able to hold her own in the tough world of mining and finance. In most of his other African novels the relationships between the Anglo Saxons settlers and the indigenous peoples are, more often than not, those of friendship, trust and mutual respect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
