  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1974 Crivitz was once again incorporated as the Village of Crivitz.  This was quickly followed by improvements in the water-sewer system, electrical system, and highway-transportation system. The village currently operates under its 1974 incorporation with a Village President (executive), a Board of Trustees (legislative), and a Municipal Judge (judicial). Village operations are carried out by the Public Works Department, Water-Sewer Department, Police Department, Fire Department, and Parks Department.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On  July 4, 2009, Crivitz cringed in the national spotlight as four municipal officers of repression (i.e., Crivitz Police) forcibly removed an upside down American flag from the private residence of a local Veteran, in anticipation of the pathetic local July 4 Parade, allegedly to celebrate &quot;America's Freedom.&quot;  The current mayor, John Deshane, while calling himself a veteran, renounced all rights to call himself an American, by claiming the subject of the Police Action should find &quot;another way to protest.&quot;  Officials at all levels admitted that no crime had been done as there is no law against flying a flag upside down.  The Wisconsin Civil Liberties Union, in a rare agreement with freedom-loving Americans across the political spectrum (including hard-right conservatives), anticipate an aggressive suit against the Village of Crivitz, which may result in its disincorporation once again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
