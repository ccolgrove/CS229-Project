  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Declan returns on the day Ryan is found guilty of Mark's murder. He comforts Faye on the courtroom steps and offers to help fund an appeal against Ryan's conviction. Declan is later shocked when Natasha later confesses to Mark's murder. He apologizes to Nathan for believing he was Mark's killer and makes him an offer. Because Natasha could not benefit from Mark's will after confessing to his murder, the money would be split between Faye, Ryan, Nathan, Will and Maisie. If Nathan could convince Natasha to sell Home Farm and her 49% of the business to Declan then he would give Nathan the money and enable him to move away from the village with Maisie and Will and make a fresh start. Nathan, however, refuses point blank to sell Home Farm to Declan, despite being unable to get any better offers. Later [[Ella Hart]] turns up at ''Home Farm'' giving Nathan an offer after he accepts, Ella makes herself at home, much to Declan's fancies but little does Nathan know that Ella is actually Declan's wife and that they have schemed Nathan into giving them ''Home Farm''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
