  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While ''[[MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors|MASH]]'' was a fairly faithful reflection of Hornberger's service in Korea, the sequels ''M*A*S*H Goes to Maine'' and ''M*A*S*H Mania'' were diverse representations of the &quot;Swamp Gang's&quot; post-Korea activities in the fictional town of Spruce Harbour, Maine, from 1953 to the 1970s. These activities mirrored Hornberger's settling in the area surrounding [[Waterville, Maine]], up to the publication of ''M*A*S*H Mania'' in 1977. The latter two novels are characterised by gentle humour, stereotypical local characters and a nostalgic look at Maine and its people through Hornberger's eyes. Throughout, the &quot;Swamp Gang&quot; prospers, gets its own way most of the time and generally become more conservative as the years pass, playing golf and being a thorn in the side of &quot;summer complaints&quot; and the local hierarchy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The action was transposed to the 1970s so that people such as [[Henry Kissinger]] could be lampooned, but this would have made some of the characters quite old, if the descriptions in the first book were to be believed. For instance, [[Margaret Houlihan|Hot Lips]] would have been into her 60s, having been described as &quot;fortyish&quot; in the first novel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
