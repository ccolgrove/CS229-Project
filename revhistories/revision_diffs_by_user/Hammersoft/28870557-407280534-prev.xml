  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the time the 1951 season rolled around, Stoll was one of the established starters in the South Bend outfield, appearing in 101 of the 111 games of her team. She posted a .268 average with 46 runs and 47 RBI, while sharing outfield duties with [[Elizabeth Mahon]] and [[Betty Wagoner]]. While South Bend placed third in the first-half standings, the team finished first in the second half, thus giving them a playoff berth. Their complete season record of 75 and 36 was best in the league that year. South Bend defeated Fort Wayne in the first round of the playoffs, two games to one, while Rockford swept Grand Rapids in two games. In the best-of-five championship round, defending AAGPBL champion Rockford won the first two games over the visiting South Bend, who won the next three games. In the 10â2 finale, Wagoner paced the Blue Sox with four hits and Faut earned the victory in a seven-inning relief, while [[Charlene Pryer]] and Stoll contributed three hits each. Considering that Rockford had won nine straight games, including the first two games in the championship series, South Bend came away a surprise winner to clinch the club's first AAGPBL title in the league.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAGPBL-Stoll/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=AAAGPBL-Records/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=SABR-Faut/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=63 1951 South Bend Blue Sox]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
