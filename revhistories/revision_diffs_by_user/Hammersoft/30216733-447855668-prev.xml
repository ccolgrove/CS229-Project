  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In his early years, Michael sought employment at Emmerdale Farm, working for [[Annie Sugden|Annie]] and [[Jack Sugden]]. He was accused of arson, when one of the barns burnt down, however, this was later proven to be the work of a labourer from another estate. Michael went on to have a relationship with [[Rachel Hughes]], however, this was jeopardised after he had a one-night stand with [[Zoe Tate]], who later [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1992, Michael took part in an armed robbery of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List of residences in Emmerdale#Home_Farm|Home Farm]], &lt;/span&gt;which left [[Joe Sugden]] badly injured and fighting for his life. The Robbery was organised by Neil Kincaid's stable hand, Steve. Following his mother's marriage to [[Eric Pollard]], several months later, Michael was arrested for his involvement in the attack, and was sentenced to four months imprisonment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Michael had long disapproved of Elizabeth's relationship with Eric. Soon after the relationship began, Michael attacked Eric in [[The Woolpack]], and punched him to the floor. However, after the [[Emmerdale plane crash]] of 1993, in which Elizabeth died, Michael accused Eric of his mother's murder. Elizabeth had discovered Eric's involvement in a cheque fraud, for which Eric had framed Michael, and left him shortly afterwards to report him to the police. However, she died en-route, apparenty killed by falling debris from the plane. However, Michael, as well as other villagers, had suspected Eric of murder. This accusation was strengthened when Eric's first wife, Eileen appeared, claiming that Eric's marriage to Elizabeth had been bigamous. This led to a heated confrontation between Michael and Eric, and the two men had a fight which left Eric unconscious on the floor. Scared that he had killed Eric, Michael fled the village in Eric's car, which was later found abandoned at the airport, revealing that Michael had fled the country.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nothing was seen or heard of Michael for 16 years until December 2010, when Eric began receiving letters, messages and cards, claiming to be from Elizabeth. Originally suspecting the messages to be sent by [[Amy Wyatt]], it was revealed on 30 December that the messages had instead been sent by Michael. Michael, who had been spending periods of time in-and-out of jail, confronted Eric at Elizabeth's grave. He later followed Eric back to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List_of_residences_in_Emmerdale#The_Grange_B_.26_B|The Grange]], &lt;/span&gt;where he again confronted Eric, prompting him to reveal his history to his current wife, [[Val Pollard|Val]]. Michael then left. However, he later informed Amy that he wanted Eric to pay him a large sum or money, otherwise he would reveal Eric to be a murderer. Eric told Michael to come in his car with him, and he would pay him off. Eric drove Michael to a remote area however, and, after an exchange of words, Eric produced a [[tyre iron]], advancing on Michael, who cowered into a corner. The result of the incident was not revealed. Eric returned to Emmerdale alone, appearing at edge and nervous, telling Val that he had given Michael a lift to the station.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Eric said that he couldn't have anymore money and Val told him that he had probably seen the coroner's report that stated his mother was killed by falling debris and that it was time to give up blaming Eric. He agreed and after a calm discussion, Eric persuaded Michael to take the money for looking after himself. Michael then got in a car and drove out of the village into the night.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
