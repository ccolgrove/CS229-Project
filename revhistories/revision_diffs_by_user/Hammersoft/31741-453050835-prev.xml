  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, the labour market is not 100% efficient: it does not clear, though it may be more efficient than bureaucracy. Some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling, which means too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot.  This assumes perfect competition exists in the labour market, specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels.  Advocates of [[supply-side]] policies believe those policies can solve this by making the labour market more flexible. These include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions. Supply-siders argue the reforms increase long-term growth. This increased supply of goods and services requires more workers, increasing employment. It is argued that supply-side policies, which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation, create jobs and reduce unemployment. Other supply-side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, recent meta-analyzes involving many studies refute that there is any statistically significant, negative impact of minimum wages on unemployment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;David Card and Alan B. Krueger, &quot;Time-series minimum-wage studies: a meta-analysis,&quot; ''American Economic Review'' 85: 238-243 (1995).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Further, a number of scholars argue that the predicted negative impact is based on incoherent or simplistic logic that ignores mitigating environmental factors, such as non-minimum wage labour markets including farm, service and self employed workers.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;P. Garegnani 1970&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Robert L.
