[[Edmund Happold]] was the senior Arup engineer for the competition. Rice became the engineer for the built project which was greatly modified from the initial design. Art and technology were intertwined in the design enabling him to experiment with materials. He brought the concepts of humanity, tactility and scale to the project His team developed the gerberette which enabled the counterbalancing of the weight of the building with light tubing, lightening the external appearance. He specified  that these were to be made in cast steel.  After the [[Pompidou Centre]], Rice set up his own company in 1977â&quot;RFR&quot;âalong with Martin Francis and Ian Ritchie although he continued with Arup as a partner. In 1978 he was involved with Rogers again, this time on [[Lloyds of London]], completed in 1984. During this time his other projects encompassed the Fleetguard Factory at [[Quimper, FinistÃ¨re|Quimper]] in France, and [[Stansted Airport]] in London.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
