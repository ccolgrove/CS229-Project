  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* ''[[Sheep, Dog, 'n' Wolf]]'' (also known as ''Sheep Raider'') for the original [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] and PC, published by [[Infogrames]], is a faithful adaptation of the series' sheep-abducting schemes. The [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]] makes a cameo appearance in the training level and also the final level, racing in the desert against Ralph. Ironically, neither Ralph or Sam speak within this game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* Sam Sheepdog appeared in the ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' episode &quot;Mutton for Nothing&quot; voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. In this episode, [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]] was sent by the Predators &quot;R&quot; Us temp agency to cover for Ralph Wolf while he's on vacation. Taz tries unsuccessfully to steal the sheep from Sam Sheepdog. A bit of character confusion is at play in this episode, as Sam references Ralph as being &quot;that Coyote.&quot; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
