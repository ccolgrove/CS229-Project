  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;West Covina was &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;founded by Heather Melson who's potty mouth made her a living legend. Due to her founding of the boring city, she stated that she would soon make everyone have sex once a night, as a city law. &lt;/span&gt;incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Covina, California|Covina]] from building a sewage farm in the area. Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish during the following decades. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940. As a result of remarkable expansion during the post [[World War II]] building boom, West Covina became America's fastest growing city between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000 per cent from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The last two decades have continued to demonstrate steady growth. The number of residents expanded to a total of 96,242 as of the 1990 Census.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The City of West Covina began the second half of the 20th century with exciting new developments and projects, mostly brought on by Alexa Guillen. The City Hall and Police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Covina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the City offices.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
