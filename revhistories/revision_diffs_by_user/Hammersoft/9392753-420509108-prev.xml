  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;In 1989, professional cheerleading costuming reached &lt;/span&gt;a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;new level.  A business was created to service NFL Cheerleaders, providing them with custom uniforms that &lt;/span&gt;the cheerleaders &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;could easily &lt;/span&gt;perform and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;move in, without compromising beauty.  The company was [[Angela King Designs]] &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;was based in California.  Angela King Designs still exists, but is currently based outside San Antonio, TX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Apart from their main duties of cheering during the football games, the cheerleaders have many other responsibilities. Nearly every team member is available for appearances at schools, events, conferences, etc., for &lt;/span&gt;a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;set fee. An anticipated annual event is the release of each squad's calendar, featuring members for each month in swimsuits, lingerie, or uniforms. As well as being a mainstay of American football culture, &lt;/span&gt;the cheerleaders &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;are one of the biggest entertainment groups to regularly &lt;/span&gt;perform &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;for the [[U.S. Military]] overseas. All performances &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;tours are enlisted by the [[United Service Organizations|USO]]. Teams send their [[variety show]], an elite group of their best members, to perform combination shows of dance, music, [[baton (twirling)|baton twirling]], [[acrobatics]], [[gymnastics]], &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;more. In February 2007, the Buffalo Bills even sent a squad of 8 along with their choreographer into the war zone of Iraq.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In 1996, The [[SF 49ers]] sent a team of 12 cheerleaders along with their director, [[Angela King-Twitero]], into the newly war torn country Bosnia.  With the aid of helicopters, the group was flown to each US Army camp in the &quot;theatre&quot; for performances and autograph signings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As of 2006, a competition strictly for NFL cheerleaders was introduced on [[The NFL Network]], called ''[[NFL Cheerleader Playoffs]]''. Two cheerleaders from each cheerleading team compete against other mini-teams in various athletic events. This includes kayaking, 100 yard dash, obstacle courses, and other events.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1992, [[Olmstead Productions]] created the [[NFL Pro Bowl Cheerleaders]].  Under the direction of [[Jay Howarth]] and [[Angela King-Twitero]] the group consisted of one all-star cheerleader from each of the [[NFL cheerleading teams]].  The elite group was choreographed by [[John Peters]].  During Pro Bowl week, the cheerleaders performed, signed autographs, and supported all the NFL activities in Hawaii.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
