  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adam was a [[photographer]] used by Detective Tapp to follow the man he suspected of being the Jigsaw Killer, Lawrence Gordon. Adam was placed into a game alongside Gordon, with them being given conflicting goals to accomplish by a certain time. After failing to complete their tests in time they were confronted by Zep Hindle. Adam beat Zep to death with a toilet tank cover while Gordon crawled away to get help. The real Jigsaw showed himself and tells Adam that the chain's key is in the bathtub, which was drained when Adam accidentally kicked the plug out--the original script of Saw III reveals that Amanda, in another act of deliberate sabotage, actually tied the water stopper to Adam's foot, guaranteeing that the key that was carelessly thrown in the tub would be flushed down the drain. Adam then grabs Zep's pistol and tries to shoot Jigsaw but is electrocuted by his hidden remote control before he can get a shot off. Jigsaw then turns off the lights and shuts the bathroom door, leaving Adam to die. Jigsaw's apprentice, Amanda, came to Adam later and [[suffocated]] him as an act of mercy. His decomposing corpse was shown in ''Saw II'' and ''Saw III''. It was revealed in ''Saw V'' that Adam's last name was Stanheight, as indicated by a document observed by [[#Peter Strahm|Agent Strahm]]. He was seen in flashbacks to the first film in ''[[Saw 3D]]'', and his corpse is shown fully decomposed with nothing left but his skeleton, still in the bathroom, at the end of the film. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;He likes heavy metal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
