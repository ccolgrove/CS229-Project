  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Cedric is selected as the Hogwarts champion for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. After Harry is also picked to compete, Malfoy makes &quot;Support Cedric Diggory/Potter Stinks&quot; badges, which Cedric tries to discourage his housemates from wearing. For the first task, Cedric transfigures a rock into a dog in order to distract his dragon and successfully retrieves his golden egg, but he receives a burn on his cheek in the process. He is later [[Cho Chang]]'s date for the [[Yule Ball]]. As compensation for Harry's warning about the dragons before the first task, Cedric assists Harry in solving the clue of the second task by telling him to take a bath with the egg in the prefects' bathroom, and just &quot;mull things over in the hot water&quot;. Cedric is the second of the four champions to reach the village of the merpeople and rescue his hostage, using a [[Spells in Harry Potter#(Bubble-Head Charm)|Bubble-Head Charm]], but surfaced one minute over the one-hour time limit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the third task, Harry saves Cedric's life twice while in the maze, and when they reach the Triwizard Cup, Cedric refuses to take it without Harry, so they grab hold of it together. The cup turns out to be a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Portkeys|Portkey]] which transports them to the Little Hangleton graveyard, where Voldemort and [[Peter Pettigrew]] await Harry's arrival; Pettigrew murders Cedric on the spot upon Voldemort's order to &quot;kill the spare&quot;. In the midst of the ''Priori Incantatem'' effect during Harry's duel with Voldemort, Cedric's spirit appears and asks Harry to take his body back to his father. Despite an attempted cover-up of the incident by the [[Ministry of Magic]], Dumbledore candidly reveals the true nature of Cedric's demise to the students at the end-of-term feast, stating that to attribute it to an accident would be &quot;an insult to his memory&quot;. Cedric Diggory was in his last year at Hogwarts, in the Goblet of Fire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
