  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Garrido operated a print shop. In the few years before his arrest he began to talk more about religion, though he had been described by others as quiet, mild mannered, intelligent and mature. Dugard acted as the graphics artist for the print shop. Ben Daughdrill, a customer of Garrido's printing business, claimed he met and spoke by telephone with Dugard and that Dugard did excellent art work. During this time, Dugard had access to the business phone and an email account. One customer of the printing business indicated she never hinted to him about her childhood abduction or true identity.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/us/29abduct.html?em|title=Kidnapping Victim Was Not Always Locked Away|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-08-28|accessdate=2009-09-01|author=McKinley, Jessie}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
