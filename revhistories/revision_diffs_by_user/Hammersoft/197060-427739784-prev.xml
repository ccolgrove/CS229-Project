  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Casting for the lead characters of ''Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at [[Rockefeller Center]]. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead, Detective [[Olivia Benson]], actresses [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Reiko Aylesworth]], and [[Mariska Hargitay]] were being considered. For the male role, Detective [[Elliot Stabler]], the finalists were [[Tim Matheson]], [[John Slattery]], [[Nick Chinlund]], and [[Christopher Meloni]]. Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and, after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, &quot;Oh well. There's no doubt who we should chooseâHargitay and Meloni.&quot; Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together, and they ended up being his first choice. [[Garth Ancier]], then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 11&quot;&amp;gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;amp;nbsp;11&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Eleven years after being cast, the two actors had become among the highest-paid lead actors on a drama, with each earning nearly $400,000 per episode, a salary that ''[[TV Guide]]'' said was exceeded only by ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'''s [[Hugh Laurie]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/Top-TV-Earners-1021717.aspx |title= Who Are TV's Top Earners? |author= Stephen Battaglio |date=August 10, 2010|publisher=[[TV Guide]] | accessdate=2010-09-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
