  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a list of the '''Goa'uld characters''' that have appeared so far in ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. In the ''[[Stargate]]'' [[fictional universe]], the [[Goa'uld]] are a fictional [[parasitic]] alien race that uses other beings as hosts. Ra stated in the ''Stargate'' film that the Goa'uld have used humans exclusively as hosts for millennia, as their technology can repair human bodies so easily that Goa'uld inhabiting human forms are for all intents and purposes ageless, though they still can be injured and killed. Most Goa'uld pose as [[deity|gods]] to control slave armies and are considered evil, [[egocentrism|egocentric]] [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniacs]] by those who do not worship them. The Goa'uld are extremely intelligent and have an aptitude for understanding, working with and using technology that is unmatched. They each have full access to their species' [[genetic memory]] from the moment of birth, meaning that no Goa'uld has to learn how to work with any technological device; they 'know' how to do so innately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
