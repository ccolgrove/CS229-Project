Though the monument was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], only foundations and sculptural fragments of the temple remain. There were previous temples on its site, where evidence of a sanctuary dates as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. The whole temple was made of marble except for the roof. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

[[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed the origin of the ''[[temenos]]'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagines already centered upon an image. In the seventh century the old temple was destroyed by a flood. The construction of the &quot;new&quot; temple, which was to become known as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|wonders of the ancient world]], began around 550 BC. It was a 120-year project, initially designed and built by the Cretan [[architect]] [[Chersiphron]] and his son [[Metagenes]], at the expense of [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
