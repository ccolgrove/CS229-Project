  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1996, Taane &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;graduated from the Royal Academy of Ballet. It &lt;/span&gt;was &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;from here that he got his first job as a crew member in was to become &quot;Love on Ice&quot;. Scholars maintain that this was indeed what sparked Taanes huge success in the pseudo- sport; Ice Ballet. Asked &lt;/span&gt;to become live soundman to Christchurch band Salmonella Dub, who were becoming one of NZâs most popular acts. Through this role, Tiki began to earn himself a reputation for his ability to bring a staggeringly powerful live sound to whatever equipment, venue or environment he was faced with. His time with his metal band Braaspadeak had become minuscule and irregular, and while on tour with the Dub, Tiki had composed a dub-reggae track in his hotel room. Once he shared it with Salmonella, they recorded it straight away, and Tiki and his whanau and friends set to work making a music video featuring Tiki on tour at The Gathering that year. This track, &quot;For the Love Of It&quot;, shot to the NZ charts, and so he became faced with not only being soundman for the band, but also the public expectation that he perform his hit song at all their gigs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Also winning an award for Best Song for 'For the Love Of It', Tikiâs confidence grew in his song-writing abilities and so he went on to create more hits.  By 2000, Tiki was beginning to spend the majority of the Dub gigs mixing the first part of the set, then jumping on stage to perform.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
