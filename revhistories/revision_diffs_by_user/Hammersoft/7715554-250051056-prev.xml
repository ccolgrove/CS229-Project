  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first building constructed on the site was the North Wagon Gate.  It was made with hand-cut [[sandstone]], which was quarried from a local site.  The state used prison labor during the construction process, and work continued on this first phase until 1876.  When completed, the total cost was of $363,061.  In addition to the North Wagon Gate, there was now north and south cellblock areas, an administration building, and personal living quarters for the warden and his family in the center, 4-story, tower section.  The facility officially opened in this year, and it had a prison population of 251 male inmates, including some who had helped construct the very prison that now held them.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Official&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
