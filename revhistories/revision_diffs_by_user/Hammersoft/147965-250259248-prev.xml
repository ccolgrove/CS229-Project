  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The trial of Albert Fish for the premeditated murder of Grace Budd began on Monday, March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]] with Frederick P. Close as judge, and Chief Assistant District Attorney, Elbert F. Gallagher, as the prosecuting attorney. James Dempsey was Fish's defense attorney. The trial lasted for ten days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], including [[coprophilia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[masochism]], but there was disagreement as to whether these activities meant he was insane. The defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with a focus on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts; Wertham stated that Fish was insane. Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters a &quot;game&quot; involving overtones of [[masochism]] and child molestation.&amp;lt;ref name=crimelibrary/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
