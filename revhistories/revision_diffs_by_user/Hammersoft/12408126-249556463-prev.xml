  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Earlier on the same night, a man named Michael Cooper was shot by Davis at a party in the nearby neighborhood of Cloverdale. It was shown in court by forensic evidence that the same gun that wounded Cooper was used to kill MacPhail.  The bullet casings from the two shootings were matched and shown to be fired by the same gun.  Davis was present at the party where Cooper was shot, but Coles was not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
