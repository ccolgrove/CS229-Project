  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Petrus Christusâ portrait of a bride and groom visiting a goldsmith is a typical example of a transitional still life depicting both religious and secular content.  Though mostly allegorical in message, the figures of the couple are realistic and the objects shown (coins, vessels, etc.) are accurately painted but the goldsmith is actually a depiction of St. Eligius and the objects heavily symbolic.  Another similar type of painting is the family portrait combining figures with a well-set table of food, which symbolizes both the piety of the human subjects and their thanks for Godâs abundance.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 41&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Around this time, simple still life depictions divorced of figures (but not allegorical meaning) were beginning to be painted on the outside of shutters of private devotional paintings.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 15&quot;/&amp;gt; Another step toward the autonomous still life was the painting of symbolic flowers in vases on the back of secular portraits around 1475.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 31&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Jacopo deâ Barbari went a step further with his ''Still Life with Partridge, Iron Gloves, and Crossbow Arrows'' (1504), among the earliest signed and dated [[trompe lâoeil]] still life paintings, which contains minimal religious content.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 34&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The 16th century witnessed an explosion of interest in the natural world and the creation of lavish botanical encyclopedias recording the discoveries of the New World and Asia. It also prompted the beginning of scientific illustration and the classification of specimens. Natural objects began to be appreciated as individual objects of study apart from any religious or mythological associations.  The early science of herbal remedies began at this time as well, a practical extension of this new knowledge. In addition, wealthy patrons began to underwrite the collection of animal and mineral specimens, creating extensive âcurio cabinetsâ.  These specimens served as models for painters who sought realism and novelty. Shells, insects, exotic fruits and flowers began to be collected and traded, and new plants such as the [[tulip]] (imported to Europe from Turkey), were celebrated in still life paintings.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, pp. 54-56&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The horticultural explosion was of wide spread interest in Europe and artist capitalized on that to produce thousands of still life paintings. Some regions and courts had particular interests. The depiction of citrus, for example, was a particular passion of the [[Medici]] court in Florence, Italy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 64&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This great diffusion of natural specimens and the burgeoning interest in natural illustration throughout Europe, resulted in the nearly simultaneous creation of modern still life paintings around 1600.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 75&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the second half of the 16th century, the autonomous still life evolved.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p.38&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Gradually, religious content diminished in size and placement in these painting, though moral lessons continued as sub-contexts. An example is âThe Butcher Shopâ by Joachim Beuckelaer (1568), with its realistic depiction of raw meats dominating the foreground, while a background scene conveys the dangers of drunkenness and lechery.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 45&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Annibale Carracci]]âs treatment of the same subject in 1583 begins to remove the moral messages, as did other âkitchen and marketâ still life paintings of this period.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 47&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
