  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Commander Shepard is the main [[player character]] in the ''[[Mass Effect (series)#Main trilogy|Mass Effect]]'' trilogy. Shepard's gender, appearance, history, combat-training and first name are determined by the player before the game begins. Shepard is 29 years old in the first game, and 31 years old in the second game. The default male Shepard, the model used by BioWare for trailers, is called John while the female default name is Jane; both defaults are of the Soldier class. The male version of Shepard is voiced by [[Mark Meer]], while [[Jennifer Hale]] lends her voice to the female version. Fashion model [[Mark Vanderloo]] was the model for the default appearance of the male commander Shepard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shepard is a veteran soldier who begins the game as a candidate to become a &quot;Spectre&quot; agent. As the game progresses, Shepard undertakes a series of important missions and is authorized to do whatever it takes to get the missions done. At the end of the game, Shepard kills villain Saren Arterius and helps defeat the Reaper ''Sovereign''. One of the most important decisions Shepard makes is at the end of the first game, and determines the fate of the Citadel Council and humanity's role in the galaxy. Shepard can choose to have the Council saved, resulting in humans being granted a Council seat; Shepard can order ''Sovereign'' to be attacked directly, which unintentionally kills the Council and results in a new, human-controlled Council being created; or Shepard can order the Council to be left undefended, which dooms the Council and sets humanity up to be the dominant species in the galaxy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
