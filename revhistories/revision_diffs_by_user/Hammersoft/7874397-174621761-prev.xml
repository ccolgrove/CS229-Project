The game begins right after Marche and his brother, Doned, move to St. Ivalice with their mother after their parents' divorce settles. The natural environment of St. Ivalice was thought to be better for Doned's severe illness. Marche participates in a snowball fight on his first day of school and plays on the same team as Mewt Randell and Ritz Malheur, both of whom he quickly befriends and later invites back to his house to see Mewt's new book. When the world is transformed into Mewt's dream world, Marche is the only character that wants the world to return to normal. Because of this, Marche is forced to battle with his own friends, take away their (and his own) dream world, and make the others see that they cannot continue a world that is simply not real. During the game, Marche ends up telling Doned about how he would keep all his emotions caged in for his brother's sake, and how hard it was to never receive attention from either parent. These tasks prove to be the most difficult challenges that Marche struggles to overcome, even more so than the many battles he fights throughout Ivalice- especially because he himself is not entirely sure if what he is doing is best. Marche bears a striking resemblance to [[Ramza]] from Final Fantasy Tactics, and also shares many personality traits.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She was friends with Marche and Mewt in St. Ivalice before the world changed. Her outspoken nature and strong sense of justice led to her unpopularity among schoolmates. Ritz's natural hair color is white, but she relentlessly dyed it pink to hide her secret. Towards the end of the game, she reveals that she doesn't want to go back to the real world because her mother looked heartbroken whenever she dyed her (Ritz's) hair. This desire leads her to consider aiding Mewt in finding Marche, and eventually, her clan battles Marche's in Siena Gorge near Ambervale. At the conclusion of the game, she learns to accept her white hair as beautiful with the help of her Viera friend Shara. A brief scene after the main game suggests that she may have a crush on Marche, though it never comes to fruition. The Official Strategy Guide features an image of Marche and Ritz together in a somewhat romantic pose, and the Official Nintendo Website portrays just the two of them (cut from the box art) on the splash page. Interestingly, Ritz takes jobs available to Viera instead of Human.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Her last gift to him was a teddy bear, which he carries around to remember her. He discovers a magical entity known as the Gran Grimoire sealed in a book that he found in a used book store. Much to his surprise, he finds that the entity has the power to shape reality to the wishes of whomever possessed it. Acting on his deepest desires, the entity changes the world into the nation of Ivalice. In this new dream world, Mewt's mother is alive, his father is the most revered man in the nation, and all of them compose Ivalice's royal family. Upon learning of Marche's attempts to destroy this dream world, he uses his power as the Prince to institute a nation-wide manhunt for his world's would-be destroyer. It isn't until after the final battle, he decides to return the world to normal. Incidentally, he is the only member of the main cast to not be present after the conclusion of the game (when players are able to go on optional missions that were not previously available). However, he is mentioned in these after-ending quests, and one mission even involves Babus trying to find his majesty's lost teddy bear (which Mewt paradoxically seems to have left when he returned to the real world, although Babus' words seem to suggest that the Prince and the Queen are still in Ambervale).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
