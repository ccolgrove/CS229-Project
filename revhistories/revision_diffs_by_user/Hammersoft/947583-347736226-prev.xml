His greatest wish is to become a member of the Headless Hunt, as mentioned in the second book. However, he is excluded due to the fact that he is not actually headless and would not be able to take part in the activities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The stare of the Basilisk is supposed to be lethal to anyone who looks at it directly in the eye. While the living students all had some barrier between them and the Basilisk (and are therefore petrified rather than killed), Nick does look at the Basilisk's eyes directly. However, since he is already dead, he too is only petrified. The character appears again in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' when Harry has been looking for some comfort to see [[Sirius Black]] again, but Nick explains that only witches and wizards who fear death can become ghosts, dashing Harry's hope of communicating with Sirius. He appears briefly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', when Harry asks him to bring him to the [[#The Grey Lady|Grey Lady]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
