  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the [[Chernobyl disaster]] the fuel became non-critical when it melted and flowed away from the graphite moderator - however, it took considerable time to cool.  The molten core of Chernobyl (that part that did not vaporize in the fire) flowed in a channel created by the structure of its reactor building and froze in place before a core-concrete interaction could happen.  In the basement of the reactor at Chernobyl, a large &quot;elephant's foot&quot; of congealed core material was found.  Time delay, and prevention of direct emission to the atmosphere, would have reduced the radiological release. If the basement of the reactor building had been  penetrated,  the groundwater would be severely contaminated, and its flow could carry the contamination far afield.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
