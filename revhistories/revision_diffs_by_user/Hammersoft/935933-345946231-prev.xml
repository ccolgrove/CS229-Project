  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the recording front, Warner artists continued to do major business. Prince enjoyed a number of substantial hits in this period but his relationship with the company grew increasingly strained in the mid-90s, climaxing in a highly publicized battle over the ownership of his master recordings, Warner Bros attitude to his recordings and his desire to be released from his contract. During 1990 Prince made his fourth film, ''[[Graffiti Bridge]]'', accompanied by an album of the same name. Warner Bros Pictures was initially reluctant to produce the film, but thanks to assurances that it would be a sequel to the hugely successful ''Purple Rain'', with the involvement of [[The Time]], [[Mavis Staples]] and [[George Clinton]], the studio approved the project. The film was panned by critics and bombed at the box office, grossing just $4.2 million&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099691/business IMDb - ''Graffiti Bridge'' - Box office]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but the recordings fared considerably better -- the album reached #6 on the Billboard 200 and R&amp;amp;B albums chart, and the single &quot;Thieves in the Temple&quot; reached #6 on the Hot 100 and #1 on the R&amp;amp;B chart.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1993 Warner Bros released the three-disc &quot;[[Greatest Hits]]&quot; compilation ''[[The Hits/The B-Sides]]''; the same year Prince stopped using his first name and adopted the so-called &quot;Love Symbol&quot;, but because this was unpronounceable, he was generally referred to as &quot;The Artist Formerly Known as Prince&quot;. By 1994, relations between Prince and Warners had broken down and he launched legal action to extricate himself from his contract. Prince claimed that Warner Bros was limiting his artistic freedom by insisting that he release albums less frequently, blaming them for the poor commercial performance of the 'Love Symbol' album, and to highlight his view he began appearing in public with the word &quot;SLAVE&quot; written on his cheek. It was during this period that Warner Bros issued the shelved ''Black Album'', even though it was already in wide circulation as a bootleg; it was released as a limited edition, but sold relatively poorly and was soon deleted. Warner Bros then acceded to Prince's wishes to issue his new album ''[[Come (album)|Come]]'' but it appeared to confirm the label's fears, becoming his poorest-selling album to date, shift barely 500,000 copies. Prince pushed to have his next album ''[[The Gold Experience]]'' released simultaneously with the Love Symbol-era material but Warners' reluctance to release it sparked Prince's lawsuit. Warner Bros. allowed the single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; (Feb. 1994) to be released via a small, independent distributor, in February 1994 and it reached #1 in the U.S. and several other countries, but Warners still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing &quot;market saturation&quot; as a defense. When eventually issued in September 1995, the album indeed failed to sell well, although it briefly entered the top 10 of the Billboard 200 and many reviewers praised it as Prince's best effort since ''Sign o' the Times''. ''[[Chaos and Disorder]]'' (1996) was his final album of new material for Warner Bros, and not surprisingly it proved to be one of his least successful releases. He subsequently released recordings on his own NPG label (via [[EMI]]) before eventually signing with [[Universal Music]] in 2005.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
