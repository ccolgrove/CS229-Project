  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Carbuncle''' is a terrestrial avatar, which are powerful beings usually in control of a specific element. Carbuncle's appearance resembles that of a cat-fox hybrid. The story of Carbuncle begins with the adventurer receiving Carbuncle's Ruby, a rare item obtained from certain leech-type monsters. If the adventurer takes it to the House of the Hero in Windurst Walls where a summoner once lived, he will be awarded with a cutscene with either Ajido-Marujido or the Cardian Joker (depending on choices made in the game). The ruby tells the adventurer to gather the &quot;seven colors of light&quot; which is actually seven of the weather effects in the game. Upon seeing all these effects, the ruby shatters and Carbuncle appears before the adventurer to which he tells them to see him in La Theine Plateau. When the certain point is found, Carbuncle appears again and tells about the other avatars in the world, and that they are sleeping and want to be awakened. Carbuncle proposes that they do this together, and the adventurer is now a [[Summoner (Final Fantasy)|Summoner]] with the ability to summon Carbuncle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''The Shadow Lord''' was the dreaded leader of the Beastmen who led them into war twenty years ago, as portrayed in the game's opening movie. As a result of this, the proud nation of Tavnazia was completely destroyed, but the Shadow Lord was struck down and sealed in his very own Castle Zvahl in Xarcabard. Four seals were placed upon his tomb, three seals for each respective nation and an extra seal in the ruins of Fei'Yin in Beaucedine Glacier. When the adventurer reaches a certain point in doing missions for their nation, they will come to realize that the Shadow Lord is being resurrected and that this must be stopped. Ultimately, one learns that the effort is futile and the only way to stop this is to journey to the Castle Zvahl and witness whatever is happening there. Upon reaching the Throne Room, the Shadow Lord comes back to life, filled with hatred. The Dark Knight Zeid reveals that this Lord is truly the Galkan Talekeeper Raogrimm. He curses Zeid for his faith in adventurers and the world, and immobilizes him, telling him to watch as he crushes the adventurer he brought. The adventurer succeeds in breaking the dark spell, turning Raogrimm back to himself again. As they prepare to leave all of this behind, Archduke Kam'lanaut and his brother Eald'narche appear and tell them how they've fooled everyone and that the Zilart will rise again. Then they release the five ancient Crystal Warriors (also known as Ark Angels) and Raogrimm turns back into the Shadow Lord and sacrifices himself to allow the rest of the adventurers to escape. After these events, the ''Rise of the Zilart'' expansion starts. Much later, it is learned that Raogrimm still lives in some form, although he is banished to live forever in the nightmare dimensions of Dynamis. After reaching lv 65 and entering Xarcabard, the adventurer is contacted by Cornelia's ghost and told to enter these dimensions in order to help Raogrimm, who has become the Dynamis Lord.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Prince Royal of the kingdom of San d' Oria, first born child of King Destin and Queen Leaute of the highly aristocratic House D'Oraguille, the royal dynasty that has ruled the Elvaan kingdom of San d'Oria for over half a millennium. Trion is the overall leader and Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Knights of San d'Oria and the most likely candidate to succeed his father King Destin as the next Monarch of San d'Oria.  He plays a vital role in the San d'Orian Mission quests and is a central figure in the final showdown with the Orcish race.  Although some of the populace (mainly the Pro-Piejue factions) consider him to be immature, rash, impatient and unfit to rule, a much larger majority of the Elvaan see him as possessing the fiery energy needed to help return San d'Oria to its peak prominence in the Vana'diel world affairs.  Prince Trion is regarded as the second-greatest swordsman in Vana'diel, second only to Lady Curilla, the only person who can best Trion in one-on-one battle.   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
