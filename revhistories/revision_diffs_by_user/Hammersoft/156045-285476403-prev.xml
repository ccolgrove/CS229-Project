  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot; was the final episode of ''M*A*S*H''. The episode aired on [[February 28]], [[1983]], and was 2Â½ hours long. It was viewed by nearly 106 million Americans (77% of viewership that night), which established it as the [[List of most-watched television episodes|most-watched episode]] in United States television history, a record that still stands. The only record it did not break was the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a TV series, which is still held by the August 1967 final episode of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', starring David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, which was watched in 72% of all American homes with television sets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
