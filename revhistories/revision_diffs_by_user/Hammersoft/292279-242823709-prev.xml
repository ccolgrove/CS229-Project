She appears to be a transsexual from her statement in &quot;[[The Parent Rap]]&quot;: &quot;you remind me of me, when I was a little boy&quot;. Her name is a play on &quot;constant harm&quot;. The character is a parody of [[Judge Judy]]. Judge Harm first appears in &quot;[[The Parent Rap]]&quot;, and a season later in &quot;[[Barting Over]]&quot;, assisting in Bart's emancipation. In &quot;[[On a Clear Day I Can't See My Sister]]&quot;, she revealed she has a husband. Her most recent appearance was in &quot;[[Rome-old and Juli-eh]]&quot;, telling Homer that he could not file for the &quot;cool kind&quot; of bankruptcy that he was expecting to solve all his problems. Although Judge Snyder resolves court cases, Judge Harm has mainly been used for handing down negative verdicts, such as sentencing a family member to prison. She also appears in &quot;[[The Wandering Juvie]]&quot; and &quot;[[Brake My Wife, Please]]&quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;''[[The Simpsons]]'' &quot;[[Brake My Wife, Please]]&quot; - May 11, 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
