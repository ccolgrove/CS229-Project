The [[Embassy Pictures]] action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply ''Runaway Train'', would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], would finally make ''[[Runaway Train (film)|Runaway Train]]'', though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=440â448}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Kurosawa would have been able to apply his skills as an action director for the first time to a [[war film]] with this production, but he was fired and replaced by two other Japanese directors by the American studio, [[20th Century Fox]], and all footage he had already shot was scrapped.|alt=A screenshot Hollywood motion picture, ''Tora!

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project. ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', produced by [[20th Century Fox]] and Kurosawa Production, would be a portrayal of the Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from both the American and the Japanese points-of-view, with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an English-speaking filmmaker directing the American half. He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but very soon the project began to unravel. The director chosen to film the American sequences turned out not to be the prestigious English filmmaker [[David Lean]], as the producers had led Kurosawa to believe, but the much less celebrated special effects expert, [[Richard Fleischer]]. The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutesâa major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968. Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to &quot;fatigue,&quot; effectively firing him. (He was ultimately replaced, for the film's Japanese sequences, with two directors, [[Kinji Fukasaku]] and [[Toshio Masuda]].)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=448â468}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
