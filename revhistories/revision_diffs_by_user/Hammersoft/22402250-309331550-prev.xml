  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The 2004 season was a disappointing year for the Blue Jays right from the beginning. They started the season 0â8 at SkyDome and never started a lengthy winning streak. Much of that was due to injuries to All-Stars Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells and Roy Halladay among others. Although the additions of starting pitchers Ted Lilly and [[Miguel Batista]] and reliever [[Justin Speier]] were relatively successful, veteran [[Pat Hentgen]] faltered throughout the season and retired on July 24. Rookies and [[minor league]] callups [[David Bush]], [[Jason Frasor]], [[Josh Towers]] and others filled the void in the rotation and the [[bullpen]]; however, inconsistent performances were evident. With the team struggling in last place and mired in a five-game losing streak, manager [[Carlos Tosca]] was fired on August 8, 2004, and was replaced by first base coach [[John Gibbons]]. Long-time first baseman Carlos Delgado became a free agent in the off-season. Nevertheless, prospects [[Russ Adams]], [[Gabe Gross]], and [[Alex RÃ­os]] provided excitement for the fans. Rookie pitchers [[David Bush]], [[Gustavo ChacÃ­n]] and [[Jason Frasor]] also showed promise for the club's future. The Blue Jays' lone MLB All-Star Game representative was Lilly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
