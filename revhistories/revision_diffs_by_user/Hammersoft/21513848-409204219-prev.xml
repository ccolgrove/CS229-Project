  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the war, 12 Field Ambulance was reverted back to the Army Reserve (Militia) and moved to Jericho Garrison in 1947. The unit was then renamed 24 Medical Company following another move to [[Bessborough Armoury]]. In 1969, the medical unit became attached to [[12 (Vancouver) Service Battalion|12 Vancouver Service Battalion]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.cflc-clfc.forces.gc.ca/pro/bc-cb/index-eng.asp&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the early 1970s, the unit was disbanded along with all militia medical units across Canada. After existing as a medical station at 12 Service Battalion for several years, the unit was raised as 12 (Vancouver) Medical Company in 1980 and is relocated back to its present location at Jericho Garrison later that year. During this period, the unit has participated in numerous peace keeping missions around the world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
