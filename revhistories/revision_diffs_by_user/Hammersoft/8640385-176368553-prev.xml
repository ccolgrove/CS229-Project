  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Steve Burnside''' (voiced by [[Bill Houston]]) is Claire's partner in the game and a playable character during a short portion of the main story. He was imprisoned in the Rockfort Island's facility alongside his father, a former Umbrella employee. He escapes from his cell during the viral outbreak. At first, he is hesitant to trust Claire and only cooperates with her reluctantly, but later becomes more open and attached to her after he is forced to kill his own father, who has become a zombie during the outbreak. He and Claire eventually end up in Umbrella's Antarctic Facility, where he is captured by [[#Alexia Ashford|Alexia]] and used as a test subject for the T-Veronica virus. Claire meets a chained Steve, who mutates into a monster and attacks Claire; in this form, he is nearly invulnerable to damage, and wields a giant, ceremonial axe. While running from Steve, Claire is attacked by one of Alexia Ashford's tentacles. Steve, seeing this, regains control of his mind and cuts the tentacle apart, freeing Claire. In relation, Alexia Ashford strikes him with one of the tentacles, inflicting a mortal wound. His failing body finally rejects the mutation, and he turns back to human. He dies in Claire's arms, just after professing his love to her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Alfred Ashford''' (voiced by [[Peter Oldring]]) is the initial [[antagonist]] during the first half of the game. He is the manager of the Rockfort Island facility and the seventh generation master of the once prestigious Ashford family. Alfred, along with Alexia are genetically altered twins created by their father from Veronica Ashford's [[DNA]]. However, he was not endowed with Veronica's superior intellect like his sister. Due to his twin sister's absence, he developed a [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality disorder]] and poses as Alexia while she is away. Claire and Steve encounter Alfred in both of his personalities during their escape from Rockfort Island, eventually chasing them into the Antarctic Facility before dying from a bullet wound from Steve and then falling from a great height. At this point, the player can pick up Alfred's sniper rifle and use it in the following battle against Nosferatu. Alfred lives just long enough to see his sister Alexia awaken from her cold storage induced sleep. When Chris is exploring the Antarctic facility, he comes across Alfred's corpse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Alexia Ashford''' (voiced by [[Leila Johnson]]) is the true antagonist of ''Code: Veronica''. She is the twin sister of Alfred and the creator of the T-Veronica virus. Alexia was created by her father from Veronica Ashford's (the first master of the Ashford clan) [[DNA]] and inherited her ancestor's superb intellect. By the time she was ten years old, she already graduated valedictorian at her university and  became a researcher for the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. Claire and Steve encounters what appears to be Alexia in Rockfort Island, but is actually her brother Alfred in drag. The real Alexia (who implanted herself with the T-Veronica Virus) later awakens from cryogenic sleep in the Antarctic Facility after Alfred's death and takes Claire and Steve captive. Chris later confronts Alexia in her mutated self during the second half of the game, in which she transform from a humanoid form into a giant [[dragonfly]]-like creature attached to a giant [[fallopian tube]], all while still retaining her intelligence and unlike most BOW's had full control of her actions. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
