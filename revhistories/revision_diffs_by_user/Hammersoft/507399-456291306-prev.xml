IHSA eventually bought the trademark rights from Intersport, and then went to court to establish its primacy.  IHSA sued GTE Vantage, an NCAA licensee that used the name March Madness for a computer game based on the college tournament.  In 1996, in a historic ruling, ''Illinois High School Association v. GTE Vantage, Inc.'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] created the concept of a &quot;dual-use trademark,&quot; granting both the IHSA and NCAA the right to trademark the term for their own purposes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In 2003, in ''March Madness Athletic Association v.
