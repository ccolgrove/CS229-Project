  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, McNally soon began to struggle with his command. In the bottom of the second inning, second baseman [[Jim Lefebvre]] tagged him for a 400-foot home run. First baseman [[Wes Parker]] hit a fair ball down the right-field foul line, but a fan reached over the wall and picked the ball out of the dirt, turning a possible triple into a ground rule double. After McNally walked [[Jim Gilliam]], [[John Roseboro]] hit a fly ball to right center, but Snyder saved at least a run with a lunging catch, and neither baserunner scored. Drysdale was pulled from the game in the third and replaced with [[Joe Moeller]], who allowed another run in the fourth when [[Davey Johnson]] scored from second on a fielder's choice by Aparicio.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With one out in the bottom of the third inning, McNally was replaced by [[Moe Drabowsky]] after loading the bases on walks. Drabowsky struck out Parker and walked Gilliam, forcing in a run, before Roseboro fouled out. Drabowsky struck out six consecutive batters (tying [[Hod Eller]]'s six in the scandal-tainted [[1919 World Series]]) in the next two innings, tying a World Series record. Drabowsky's total of 11 strikeouts in {{frac|6|2|3}} innings of relief are a record for a relief pitcher in a World Series game. The Orioles won, 5â2, and the Dodgers would not get another runner across the plate in the series.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
