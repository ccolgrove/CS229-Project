  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The center, intended to replace [[Gregory Gymnasium]], cost $34 million to build in 1977. The first event to play at the Center was a UT basketball game which occurred on November 29, 1977  [http://www.uterwincenter.com/applause/2007/mar07ap/erc30.html] UT began renovations of the center in 2001 and finished in 2003. Renovations included: Life safety upgrades, new concession stands and restrooms, addition of 28 suites, new scoreboard and indoor electronic video signs, addition of outdoor electronic video signs, and Lone Star Room (reception hall) renovations. The building is named for former UT Board of Regents member Frank Erwin, who attended the The University of Texas and was a member of the same fraternity, [[Kappa Sigma]], as several other prominent alumni who have had buildings at the University named after them (such as [[Beauford Jester]], [[Denton Cooley]], William Hogg and [[Harry Huntt Ransom]]). As a Regent, Frank Erwin was instrumental in the university making great strides in the expansion of its facilities during his term (1963 to 1975).&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;University of Texas Facilities&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.texassports.com/facilities/tex-facilities.html | title=University of Texas Facilities | publisher=Texas Sports | accessdate=2006-11-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Originally known as the Special Events Center, the facility was renamed in 1980 to honor Erwin, who had died that same year.
