While ''Drama'' was well received by many fans, and often regarded as one of the finest moments for the trio of Squire, Howe, and White, despite the Horn/Downes contribution, many other Yes followers missed Anderson's unique lyrics and vocal style.

When the band returned to England later in 1980, the English press heaped great criticism on Horn and Yes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

This would lead to the end of Yes having new albums released by Atlantic Records after more than 20 years of their initial recording contract. Throughout early 1991, phone calls were made, lawyers soothed, and agreements were struck, with Yes West joining ABWH for the ''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' album. Each group did its own songs, with Jon Anderson singing on all tracks. Chris Squire sang background vocals on a few of the ABWH tracks (with Tony Levin doing all the bass on those songs). The album was clearly a somewhat forced combination of the music from the two line-ups, since none of the songs on ''Union'' featured all eight members at once; two-thirds were actually ABWH compositions, while Trevor Rabin and Chris Squire contributed four songs (including the Billy Sherwood collaboration &quot;The More We Live&quot;). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The album itself fared well, with approximately 1.5 million sold worldwide. However, nearly the entire band have subsequently - and openly - stated their disliking for the finished product predominantly due to producer [[Jonathan Elias]] and [[Jon Anderson]]'s involvement of session musicians on the ABWH tracks (the four Rabin supplied songs were all recorded and produced by the ''YesWest'' line-up) after the initial sessions. Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit, and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine. He has gone on record as referring to the entire venture as &quot;Onion&quot; because it makes him cry when he thinks about it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
