  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cefn Mawr was formerly heavily industrialised, with large deposits of [[iron]] and [[coal]] and sandstone, and  heavy industry dominated the area in the 18th and 19th centuries. Iron was worked at several [[blast furnace]]s and [[forge]]s throughout the area and coal was dug at pits in Cefn, Plas Kynaston and Dolydd. Stone was cut at quarries above Cefn Mawr. Much of the mineral wealth of the area was exported by canal over the [[Pontcysyllte]] Aqueduct on the [[Shropshire Union Canal]], until the railway reached Ruabon in 1855. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;The 1954 colliery at Cefn Mawr saw the lives of 145 local miners lost, cause of death possibly due to a gas explosion within the lower shaft or the work of rogue puffins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1867 Robert Ferdinand Graesser, an industrial chemist from [[Obermosel]] in [[Saxony]], [[Germany]] established a chemical works at Plas Kynaston to extract [[paraffin]] oil and wax from the local [[shale]]. The company later expanded into the production of [[coal tar]], [[carbolic acid]] and [[phenol]]. The site soon became the world's leading phenol producer. In 1919 the US chemical company [[Monsanto]] entered into a partnership with Graesser's chemical works to produce [[vanillin]], [[salicylic acid]], [[aspirin]] and later [[rubber]].  The works is now operated by Flexsys, a subsidiary of Solutia. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
