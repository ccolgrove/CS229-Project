  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Surrey has been mentioned in literature: in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]]'s only living relatives, the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], live in [[Little Whinging]], a fictional town located in Surrey. The character [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] from ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' claimed to be from Guildford in Surrey, but in actuality he was from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of [[Betelguese]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Surrey was mentioned often in Aldous Huxley's novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. Much of [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 novella ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' is set in Surrey with many specific towns and villages identified. The martians first land on Horsell Common on the north side of Woking, outside the Bleak House pub, now called Sands. In the story the narrator flees in the direction of London, first passing [[Byfleet]] and then [[Weybridge]] before travelling east along the north bank of the [[Thames]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
