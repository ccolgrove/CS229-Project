  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Steven K. Benjamin, a graduate of the USC Law school and USC political science Undergraduate program was recently elected as the First Black African American Mayor of Columbia, South Carolina in 2010. Benjamin has a resume that would rival that of any political figure in the nation. He is a native of New York but now calls Columbia, South Carolina home. Benjamin is a former Student Body President himself. He is being urged to run for the office of Governor of South Carolina in the wake of the chaos and scandal surrounding the present governor in office. In the words uttered in the campaign run by President Obama taking over for the now former but ill witted George W. Bush, &quot;He will definitely do better than our present leader, because only a fool could do worse&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
