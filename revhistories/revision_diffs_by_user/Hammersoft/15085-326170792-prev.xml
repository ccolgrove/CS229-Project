  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Despite a religious prohibition on destroying or converting houses of worship,{{Facts|date=February 2007}} certain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated whilst the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932. More dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of [[India]] where Hindu and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques raised on their place (for example, the [[Qutub Complex]] and [[Babri Mosque]]). Sikanser Butshikan had ordered demolition, of what would have been today, a very old historical heritage, as what he had destroyed at that time were itself historic during his era. In present Kashmir territory in South Asia, he insisted on all golden and silver images being broken and melted down, and the metal coined into money. Many of the Brahmins who lived there, who were of different faith, rather than abandon their religion or their country, poisoned themselves; some emigrated from their native homes, while a few escaped the evil of banishment by becoming Mahomedans. After the emigration of the Brahmins, Sikundur ordered all the temples in Kashmeer to be thrown down; among which was one dedicated to Maha Dew, in the district of Punjhuzara, which they were unable to destroy, in consequence of its foundation being below the surface of the neighbouring water. But the temple dedicated to Jug Dew was levelled with the ground; (...) but Sikundur (...) did not desist till the building was entirely razed to the ground, and its foundations dug up. In another place in Kashmeer was a temple built by Raja Bulnat, the destruction of which was attended with a remarkable incident. (....) Having broken all the images in Kashmeer, he acquired the title of the Iconoclast, âDestroyer of Idolsâ.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
