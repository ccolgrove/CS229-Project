  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gill began a new chapter in his career in 1987, when he replaced [[Bobby Brown]] in [[New Edition]],  a 1980s [[Pop music|pop]] group. With Gill as one of the lead singers, the group developed a more mature, adult sound, hitting the charts with songs such as &quot;Can You Stand The Rain,&quot; &quot;N.E. Heartbreak,&quot; and the Gill-led &quot;Boys To Men.&quot;  He is the oldest member of New Edition, although Ricky Bell was originally the oldest member before Gill joined the group.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
