  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1982, Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Honkytonk Man]]'', based on the novel by [[Clancy Carlile]] about an aspiring country music singer named Red Stovall, set during the [[Great Depression]]. The script was adapted slightly from the novel; the scene in the novel of where Red gives a reefer to his fourteen-year old son (played by real-life son Kyle) was not approved by Eastwood and altered and the ending was also changed to the playing on the radio of a song written by Red on his death bed, shortly before his burial.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.344&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The film was shot in the summer of 1982 within six weeks.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.345&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The first part of the movie was filmed in [[Bird's Landing, California]], although the majority of this feature was filmed in and around [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras County]], east of [[Stockton, California]]. Exterior scenes include Main Street, [[Mountain Ranch, California|Mountain Ranch]]; Main Street, [[Sheepranch, California|Sheepranch]]; and the Pioneer Hotel in Sheepranch. Extras were locally hired and many of the towns' residents are seen in the movie. The film received a mixed reception upon release, although it has a high score of 93% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. In 1982, Eastwood also directed, produced and starred in the [[Cold War]]-themed ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'', based on a 1977 [[Firefox (novel)|novel with the same name]] by British novelist [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]]. ''Firefox'' is an espionage thriller, about a retired Air Force Special Forces Expert, recruited to steal a Soviet supersonic war plane from [[Moscow]]. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the [[Cold War]], and much footage was shot at the [[Thule Air Base]] in [[Greenland]] and in [[Austria]] to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.337&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The film was actually shot before ''Honkeytonk Man'' but was released after it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fourth ''Dirty Harry'' film ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' (1983), is widely considered to be the darkest, &quot;dirtiest&quot; and most violent film of the series. This would be the last time he starred in a film with frequent leading lady [[Sondra Locke]]. The script, written by [[Joseph Stinson]], is about a woman (Locke) who avenges the [[rape]] of herself and her sister (now a vegetable) by a ruthless gang at a fairground. The woman systematically murders her rapists one by one, shooting them once in the genitals and once in the head. Pat Hingle and [[Bradford Dillman]] also starred alongside Eastwood and footage was shot in the spring and early summer of 1983. The line, &quot;[[Go ahead, make my day]]&quot;, uttered by Eastwood during an earlier scene in which his regular morning cafe is threatened by robbers, is often cited as one of cinema's immortal lines and was famously referenced by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in his campaigns. The film was the highest earning of all the Dirty Harry films, earning $70 million and received rave reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.352&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
