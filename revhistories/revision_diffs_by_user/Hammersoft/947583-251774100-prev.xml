  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Harry first meets Quirrell at the [[Diagon Alley#The Leaky Cauldron|Leaky Cauldron]], while being escorted by Hagrid to [[Diagon Alley]] to shop for school supplies. Quirrell is next seen at Hogwarts conversing with Snape at the start-of-term banquet, and then regularly while teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons. During the school's Halloween banquet, Quirrell appears in the Great Hall to warn staff and students of a troll in the dungeons, and then promptly faints. Harry, Ron, and Hermione come to suspect that Snape is on a mission from Voldemort to steal the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#The Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] from a secret chamber in Hogwarts, where it is hidden. When Harry finally arrives in the chamber, he discovers that it is not Snape, but Quirrell who is the real villain. During the climax of the story, as Harry and Quirrell struggle to recover the stone from the [[Mirror of Erised]], Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell's head, formerly concealed by the turban, and speaks directly to Harry, threatening to kill him if he does not assist Voldemort in recovering it. After Harry refuses, Voldemort orders Quirrell to attack Harry, who holds off Quirrell long enough for aid to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees, in his non-physical form. Voldemort's departure, as well as the agony suffered by him because of his contact with the morally pure Harry, causes Quirrell to die.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
