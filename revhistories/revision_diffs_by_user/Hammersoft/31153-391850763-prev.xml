  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* [[Cary Elwes]] as Westley, a farmboy who is tormented and dismissed by Buttercup, faithfully replying &quot;As you wish&quot; to her requests, meaning that he loves her, as she comes to realize. Westley leaves soon after they discover their love to make the money necessary for them to marry, but is reported dead after his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Westley, as he later explains, was indeed attacked by Roberts, but when given the chance to beg, he merely bade that he save his life. Roberts, intrigued by the pleas, allowed him to explain his mission, taking him on as his apprentice and eventually befriending him, bestowing upon Westley the title of Captain Roberts (which had been handed down by the original Roberts to each first mate). As the Dread Pirate Roberts, Westley returns to Florin and successfully defeats Vizzini's men Inigo and Fezzik, building relationships of mutual respect with both. He rescues Buttercup and explains how he survived while journeying through the Fire Swamp to escape Prince Humperdinck, who is searching for Buttercup. However, they are ambushed, and he is taken to Rugen's torture chamber. Prince Humperdinck, enraged at Buttercup's faithfulness, kills Westley. However, it turns out he was only mostly dead and, with the help of Miracle Max, he is revived by Inigo and Fezzik, who seek his aid to invade the castle. Westley, still paralyzed, accompanies them and is rejoined with Buttercup, explaining that her earlier marriage was a sham because &quot;I do&quot; was never said. Westley then bluffs his way out of a sword fight with the Prince. Westley, Buttercup, Inigo and Fezzik then escape on white stallions conveniently found by Fezzik.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* [[Robin Wright Penn|Robin Wright]] as Buttercup, Westley's true love who at first teased him constantly; she eventually realizes that his faithful response &quot;As you wish&quot; means that he loves her, and she discovers that she loves him too. Buttercup is forced to become Prince Humperdinck's fiancÃ©e after Westley is reported killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never leaves his victims alive. She is captured by Vizzini, Inigo Montoya and Fezzik on her daily ride, but rescued by a man in black, who reveals himself as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and after Buttercup kicks him down a hill, she recognizes him as Westley. The couple travel through the dreaded Fire Swamp to escape the Prince's search party, but are cornered, and Buttercup surrenders herself in exchange for Westley's safety. She has several horrible nightmares and expresses discomfort at marrying, remaining faithful that Westley will come for her as he promised, enraging Humperdinck so that he kills Westley. The Prince later forces a rushed wedding, but they never say &quot;I do&quot;, making it a sham, as a revived Westley explains to her. Buttercup ties up Humperdinck and rides off with Westley, Inigo and Fezzik.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
