  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;''Star Fox'' is a [[rail shooter]] in a third-person and first-person [[3D computer graphics|3D]] perspective. The player must navigate Fox's spacecraft, an [[Star Fox (series)#Arwing|Arwing]], through environments while various enemies (spaceships, robots, creatures, etc.) attack him.  Along the way various [[power-up]]s are placed in the stage to help the player. The player receives a score on each level based on how many enemies destroyed and how well the player has defended his/her teammates. At the end of each [[Level (computer and video games)|level]] there is a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] that the player must defeat before progressing to the next level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;''Star Fox'' possesses certain unique elements that differentiate it from the standard scrolling shooter. Most scrolling shooters force the player forward at a constant speed. While this is also true for ''Star Fox'', there are thrusters and retro-rockets on the Arwing that allow the player to temporarily speed up and slow down. These can be used to maneuver around enemy attacks and other obstacles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
