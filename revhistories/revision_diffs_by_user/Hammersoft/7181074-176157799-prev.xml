Ed is utterly at the mercy of his tyrannical younger sister Sarah, who he cares for deeply, and is an easy target for her [[manipulation]]s. Much to the [[Wiktionary:dismay|dismay]] of [[Wiktionary:mysophobe|germophobic]] Edd, he has poor personal hygiene, even to the point of being terrified of [[soap]].

To differentiate his [[homophone|homophonic]] name from that of Ed, everyone in the series calls him Double-D. His parents put a heavy workload on him, communicating an excess of tasks solely through a multitude of [[sticky note]]s. Edd hates being treated terribly by everyone and gets a little frustrated. Edd is normally a straight-A student in all of his classes and hates sports.  Edd is an excellent [[pedal steel guitar]] player, although he insists that he loathes the instrument. Edd is amazingly intelligent, able to construct complicated machines from [[cardboard]], [[signs]], and various [[junk]] the Eds come across.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

It is purposely never stated which country he's from, so his personality is not committed to a certain culture. He works his parents' small farm within the [[cul-de-sac]], and leads a [[scouting]] group called the &quot;Urban Rangers&quot;, which includes Jimmy, Plank, and Jonny. Rolf usually refers to himself in [[Grammatical person|third person]], as well as being the son of a [[shepherd]], in which he takes pride. His faithful farm animals are two pigs (one named Wilfred), a goat named Victor, at least four chickens (two named Bridget and Gertrude), a cow, and 5 sheep. He hardly minds the Eds unless they make a fool out of him, after which he is not afraid to use brute force. Rolf confuses the Eds to no end with his unusual customs and food-making.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
