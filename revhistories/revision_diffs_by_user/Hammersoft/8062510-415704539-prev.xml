  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the way &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;to school, &lt;/span&gt;the [[Junior Detective League]] witness a policemen being killed by an unknown man. [[Jimmy Kudo|Conan Edogawa]] learns from the police that a killer has recently been murdering police officers in the area and that the killer has some sort of connection to the police. During a party, [[Miwako Sato|Simone Miwako]] is critically wounded by the killer. [[Rachel Moore (Case Closed)|Rachel Moore]] having witnessed the event has become traumatized by it and as a result, has been diagnosed with [[retrograde amnesia]]. While Conan investigates the culprits motive, he links the murders to a past case where the police were unable to solve. Conan realizes the culprit was murdering officers who were planning on re-opening the case and deduces who the murderer is. The murderer, revealed to be the psychologist tending to Rachel, attempts to murder her as she saw his face when he shot Simone. Conan manages to intervene and reveals that the psychologist was once a heart surgeon that was intentionally injured by another doctor and was forced to retire. The psychologist then murdered the doctor and the police closed the case deeming it a suicide. However, upon discovering that the case would be reopened, he decided to kill the officers who were investigating the matter to protect his identity. Conan and Rachel escape from the psychologist and after a long chase, they are cornered. Rachel regains her memory just as Conan disarms the criminal. However, the psychologist manages to grab Conan and reveals a hidden knife and prepares to stab him, only to be stopped by Rachel's [[Karate]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
