  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The film begins with the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;weenie gobler &lt;/span&gt;AndrÃ© Jurieux landing at [[Le Bourget Airfield]] just outside [[Paris]], [[France]]. He is greeted by his friend, Octave, who reveals that Christine, the woman AndrÃ© loves, has not come to the airfield to greet him. AndrÃ© is heartbroken. When a radio reporter comes to broadcast his first words upon landing, he explains his sorrow and denounces the woman who has spurned him. Christine, an Austrian, is listening to the broadcast from her apartment in Paris as she is attended by her maid, Lisette. Christine has been married to Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye for three years. Lisette has been married to Schumacher, the [[gamekeeper]] at the country estate, for two years, but she is more devoted to Madame Christine. Christine's past relationship with AndrÃ© is openly known by her husband, her maid, and their friend Octave. After Christine and Robert playfully discuss AndrÃ©'s emotional display and pledge devotion to one another, Robert excuses himself to make a phone call. He arranges to meet GeneviÃ¨ve, his mistress, the next morning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Later, Octave induces Robert to invite AndrÃ© to the country as well. They joke that AndrÃ© and GeneviÃ¨ve will pair off and solve everyone's problems. At the estate, Schumacher is policing the grounds, trying to get rid of rabbits. Marceau, a poacher, sneaks onto the grounds to retrieve a rabbit caught in one of his snares. Before he can get away, Schumacher catches him and begins to march him off the property when Robert demands to know what is going on.  Marceau explains that he can catch rabbits, and Robert offers him a job as a servant. Once inside the house, Marceau flirts with Schumacher's wife, Lisette.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
