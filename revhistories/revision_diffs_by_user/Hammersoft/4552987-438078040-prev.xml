  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* [[Sapience|Sapient]] settlements will normally form in locations where there is a suitable economic need for a population center. This could be a port along a river or coast for trading; a location that is favorable for farming or resource gathering; or a commerce center along a land trade route. Less frequently settlements may form for particular cultural reasons, such as the proximity of a [[religion|religious]] site.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Early maps will often be sketched out by hand in a simple fashion, drawing in the oceans, mountains, and forests, and adding in the cities, national borders, and other features of interest. When greater detail is needed, more detailed maps are then created for specific locations. If professional results are needed, the maps can then be created by an [[artist]]. There are also special software packages such as [[Campaign Cartographer]] that are available that allow the creation of good maps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
