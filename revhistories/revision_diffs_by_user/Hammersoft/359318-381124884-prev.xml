  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* Venom appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. In this series, Eddie Brook is a close friend of Peter who works alongside him as an assistant at Empire State University for Dr. Curt Connors. The symbiote was to be studied by Connors after it was discovered on John Jameson's shuttle, but bonded with Spider-Man in a fight with Black Cat causing the lab to lose a grant and Eddie to lose his job. Spider-Man attempts to destroy it after discovering its negative influence, but Eddie (who is already angry with Peter and Spider-Man for various reasons) frees the alien and bonds with it, becoming Venom. At the end the season one finale, the symbiote is tricked into leaving Eddie and Spider-Man buries the symbiote in cement. In the second season, Eddie follows Peter and eventually frees the symbiote. He then attempts to expose Spider-Man's identity, but again fails when the alien rejects him and escapes. Afterward, Eddie is hauled off to a psychiatric facility, vowing that the symbiote will return and that they will destroy Spider-Man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
