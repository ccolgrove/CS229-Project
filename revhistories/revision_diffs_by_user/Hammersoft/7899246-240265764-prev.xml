The exact details of his creation are hopelessly confused, but he was apparently meant to be an alien spying weapon, and was stolen by a paramilitary group before he simply &quot;got high and wandered off&quot; to South Park. He often speaks in a high pitched voice. He is usually seen either giving towel-related advice to the citizens of South Park or, more often, getting high on [[marijuana]]. Towelie constantly reminds other characters, &quot;Don't forget to bring a towel!&quot; Then, after an awkward pause, he asks the subjects, &quot;You wanna get high?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

He first appeared in the episode &quot;[[Jared Has Aides]]&quot;, though his name was not given until &quot;[[Child Abduction Is Not Funny]]&quot;.  According to the DVD commentary on &quot;Jared Has Aides&quot;, Kim is based on an actual person. While doing [[sound mixing]] on their film ''[[Orgazmo]]'', Parker and Matt Stone would phone a real life [[City Wok]] just to hear the manâs voice. Kimâs main job is the owner of City Wok, a Chinese take out service. He also operates the airline service City Airlines in &quot;[[It's Christmas in Canada]]&quot;. In &quot;[[Child Abduction Is Not Funny]]&quot;, he is established to be an expert at building walls, a stereotypical parody of the Chinese building of the [[Great Wall of China]], although his efforts are thwarted by a pack of [[Mongolians]]. He is also depicted as being married to the singer [[Wing (singer)|Wing]] in the [[Wing (South Park)|episode of the same name]]. Also, in  the episode [[Night of the Living Homeless]] he can be seen as one of the homeless people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
