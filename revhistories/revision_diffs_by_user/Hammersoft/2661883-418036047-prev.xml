She is resourceful and able to capitalize on opportunities when they present themselves to her. Because she doesn't speak English, the other residents of the apartment ignore her. However, her &quot;partner&quot; in the Westing Game, Jake Wexler, talks to her, since he realizes that she will never learn English unless someone speaks it to her. She dreams of  going back to China, so she is stealing valuable things from the other heirs. In the book's finale, her friendship with Jake pays off; 'Sunny' has become fluent in English and taken over her husband's business. At the end of the book, she visits China.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
