As he gazes into the pit, he decides that no fate could be worse than falling into it. It is implied by the text that the narrator fears what he sees at the bottom of the pit, or perhaps is frightened by its depth. The exact cause of his fear is not clearly stated. However, as the narrator moves back from the pit, he sees that the red-hot walls are closing in, leaving him with no foothold. As the prisoner begins to fall into the pit, he hears human voices. The walls rush back and an arm catches him. The French Army has taken [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and the [[Inquisition]] is in the hands of its enemies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The rescuers are led by Napoleon's General [[Antoine Charles Louis Lasalle|Lasalle]] (who was not, however, in command of the French occupation of [[Toledo Spain|Toledo]]) and this places the action  during the [[Peninsular War]], centuries after the height of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and at a time when it had lost much of its power. The elaborate (and presumably costly) tortures of this story have no historic parallels in the activity of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in any century, let alone the nineteenth. The Inquisition was, however, abolished during the period of French intervention (1808-13).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
