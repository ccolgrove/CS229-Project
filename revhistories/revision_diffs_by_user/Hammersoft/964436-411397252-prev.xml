The train passed a [[railway signal|signal]] {{convert|2.1|mi}} north of [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] traveling between {{convert|60|and|70|mph|km/h}} and the engineer decreased the throttle and started applying the brakes in preparation for entering the station.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&quot;Accident at Union Station&quot;, p. 6.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; When the engineer realized that the train was not slowing down, and applying the [[emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] had no effect, he proceeded to sound the engine's horn. A [[signalman (rail)|signalman]], on hearing the horn and noting the excessive speed of the 4876, phoned ahead to the [[station master]]'s office.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Loftus 16&quot;&amp;gt;Loftus 1953, p. 16.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; 4876 negotiated several [[Railroad switch|switches]] without derailing, at speeds well over the safe speed limits and entered the station at around {{convert|35|to|40|mph}}.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;accident 5&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;Accident at Union Station&quot;, p. 5.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The train rammed the [[buffer stop]]s, continued through the station master's office and into the [[concourse]].&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;accident 5&quot;/&amp;gt; The weight of 4876 caused it to fall through the floor and into the station's basement.
