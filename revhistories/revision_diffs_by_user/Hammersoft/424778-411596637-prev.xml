At [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|Elimination Chamber]], Jericho won the World Heavyweight Championship in an [[Elimination Chamber]] match, lastly eliminating the defending champion [[The Undertaker]] following interference from [[Shawn Michaels]]. The next night on Raw, Edge announced that he would be facing Jericho at [[WrestleMania XXVI]] for the World Heavyweight Championship. Over the next several weeks leading up to Wrestlemania, Edge was on a &quot;spear frenzy&quot;, as every time Jericho would appear, he would spear Chris, or attempted to as certain weeks Jericho would hit a [[Codebreaker]] or hit Edge with the World Heavyweight Championship belt. Jericho defeated Edge at WrestleMania, retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match however, Edge speared Jericho from the announce table through the barricade. During the April 2, 2010 episode of [[WWE Smackdown|SmackDown!]], [[Jack Swagger]] cashed in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract and pinned Jericho for the championship after he had been [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|speared]] by Edge just moments before. Later in the show, [[Theodore Long]] confirmed a #1 contenders match for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] for the next week involving Jericho and Edge. The match ended in a double count-out. Afterwards, an enraged Edge speared Jericho again. The following week, both Jericho and Edge were placed in a triple threat match with Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Swagger retaining. At [[Extreme Rules (2010)|Extreme Rules]] Jericho faced Edge in a Steel Cage Match and would go on to lose after Edge walked out the door.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
