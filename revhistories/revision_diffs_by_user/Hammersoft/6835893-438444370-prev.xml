Members of [[Public Security Section 9|Section 9]] as well as their Tachikoma tanks have the ability to activate a special camouflage technology which enables them to blend in with the environment, making them near-invisible to the naked eye. It is an active stealth system which projects ambient conditions of the opposing side, thus rendering the masked object transparent by transmission. The system is not shown to be perfect, as it seems unable to compensate for sudden changes and physical impacts and not impervious to close observation.  It also has difficulty working in rain or if walking through shallow water.  A faint translucent distortion is shown as the limitations of the technology. In the legal landscape of the series, usage of the technology without a warrant is heavily restricted. The use of this technology by Section 9 is the exception, and not the norm - further highlighting their extraordinary legal standing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Think tank&quot; is a slang term used to describe a robotic [[weapons platform]] that makes use of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) to enhance its abilities. In the Japanese version, they are officially referred to as {{nihongo|&quot;multi-legged tanks&quot;|å¤èæ¦è»|Takyakusensha}}, but they are more commonly referred to as {{nihongo|&quot;think tanks&quot;|æèæ¦è»|Shinku|the kanji are read as &quot;Think&quot; rather than ''ShikÅsensha''}}. The most prominent think tanks are those used by Section 9 in its various incarnations, including the {{nihongo|Fuchikoma|ããã³ã}} (original manga), {{nihongo|Tachikoma|ã¿ãã³ã}} (''Stand Alone Complex''), and {{nihongo|Uchikoma|ã¦ãã³ã}} (''[[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society|Solid State Society]]''). Section 9's think tanks are spider-like in appearance, having four walking legs, a pair of front-mounted manipulators, and a segmented body. The pilot sits in a posterior pod attached to the main body, but the tanks can operate independently using their AI.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;manga1&quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite comic | cartoonist = Masamune Shirow | story =  | title = Ghost in the Shell | volume =  | issue =  | date = 1991 | publisher = Titan Books | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The AI of the tanks exhibit learning algorithms to help them adapt to new situations and these experiences are synchronized among the tanks after each mission. Fuchikoma and Tachikoma AIs have child-like personalities and the latter's AI develop rapidly over the course of ''Stand Alone Complex'', almost to the point of sentience and individuality. Uchikoma are seen at the end of ''2nd GIG'' after the destruction of the satellite containing the Tachikoma AIs. Their AIs are considerably less advanced, and their failure during a mission in ''Solid State Society'' leads to the return of the Tachikoma.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
