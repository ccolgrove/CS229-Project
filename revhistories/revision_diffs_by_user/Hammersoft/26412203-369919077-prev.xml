[[Irving Kershner]] was originally intended as director as was [[Frank Sinatra]] to play the character but he had reportedly grown unhappy with the script, although withdrew officially because of a hand injury.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan205&quot;/&amp;gt; While ''Play Misty for Me'' was attractive to Eastwood, &quot;by the sadness of the character&quot;, he signed up for Dirty Harry and this was reported in the press in December 1970 that Malpaso would be producing the film in a joint venture with Warner Brothers.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan206&quot;&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.206&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Many locations in the script were altered and moved to [[San Francisco]]. One evening Eastwood and Siegel had been watching the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in the [[Kezar Stadium]] in the last game of the season and thought the eerie Greek [[amphitheatre]] like setting would be an excellent location for shooting one of the scenes where Callahan encounters the psychopathic killer Scorpio.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan206&quot;/&amp;gt; A railway trestle crossing over [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]] would be used in the finale. [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]], who Eastwood had seen in a play called ''[[Subject to Fits]]'' was cast as the killer Scorpio, whose unkept appearance fit the bill for a mentally ill hippie.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan207&quot;&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.207&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Past collaborators Surtees, Pingitore and Schifrin were once again hired, with Schifrin composing many of the jazz tracks to the film. [[Glenn Wright]], Eastwood's costume designer since ''Rawhide'' was responsible for creating Callahan's distinctive old-fashioned brown and yellow checked jacket to emphasise his strong values in pursuing crime.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan207&quot;/&amp;gt; Filming for Dirty Harry began in April 1971 and involved some risky stunts, with much footage shot at night and filming the city of San Francisco aerially which the film series is renowned for.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan207&quot;/&amp;gt;  Dirty Harry is arguably Eastwood's most memorable character and the lines that Callahan utters when addressing a wounded bank robber are often cited amongst the most memorable in cinematic history (see box).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
