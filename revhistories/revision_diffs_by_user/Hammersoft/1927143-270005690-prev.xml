Her disposition is grouchy at best, she hates her job, she hates her students, and she has hated Frazz ever since he was 'her' student. The only good that comes of her reign is that her students learn how to live under a malevolent authority figure while they still have the resilience to overcome it (which could come in handy in the future when they enter the adult world and work force). Another side of her character is seen when Caulfield gets a summer job in her garden (a summer 2005 sequence in ''Frazz'') and they come to have a sense of respect for each other.  She is a terrible driver, so much so that Caulfield and other students have set up a [[betting pool]] to predict how many parking-lot accidents she will have by the end of the school year. Although Mrs. Olsen resembles the character of Miss Wormwood from [[Bill Watterson]]'s ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' comic strip, she is a composite of several of Mallett's teachers and one of Mallett's wife's teachers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
