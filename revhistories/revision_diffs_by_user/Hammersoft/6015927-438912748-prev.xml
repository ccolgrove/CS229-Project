Proudfootâs immediate influence on programming was to drop a plan to broadcast a mixture of light music and lifestyle material in favour of a simple Top 40 format. A 30 year old, 150 tonne fishing vessel named Ocean 7 was acquired and fitted out with a 10&amp;amp;nbsp;kW radio transmitter for a total cost of Â£75,000. The radio station was named [[Radio 270]] and it was run from Proudfootâs business headquarters in Scalby Road, Scarborough. Ocean 7 was registered in Honduras in the name of Radio 270's programme director Noel Miller (an Australian national). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Although it attracted a large body of regular listeners (up to 4 million was claimed) its affairs were controversial. One issue was that Ocean 7 was too small to operate comfortably off the exposed North East coast. By way of comparison with Radio 270's operation, [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] (&quot;the Big L&quot;) broadcast from the 650 tonne [[MV Galaxy (radio ship)|MV Galaxy]] in the sheltered Thames estuary. After Ocean 7 nearly sank in a winter storm, several of the shipâs crew and [[disc jockey]]s threatened to mutiny. There were ongoing arguments concerning the safety of the ship, terms of employment and financial policy.  Proudfoot resolved disputes with company officers, staff and fellow investors by dismissing those concerned. He also gave airtime to political causes, such as support for the white minority regimes in [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]] being voiced by Conservative MP [[Patrick Wall]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
