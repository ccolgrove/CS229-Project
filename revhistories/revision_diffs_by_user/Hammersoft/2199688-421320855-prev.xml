  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[NASCAR]]'s top series found sponsorship from [[Reynolds American Inc.|R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] (RJR) in the early 1970s following the U.S. ban on television advertising of cigarettes. The &quot;Winston Cup&quot; became the top competitive series, and later, some other regional series under NASCAR were also sponsored by the tobacco company (for example, the &quot;Winston West&quot; series). In the mid-1970s, some races began to get partial television coverage, frequently on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sports variety show, ''[[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''. While Winston was not able to do commercial advertisements, their name was all over television during races. Over the many years of their relationship with NASCAR, Winston sponsored several races and prize programs including the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]], [[NASCAR NEXTEL All-Star Challenge|The Winston all-star race]], the [[Winston Western 500]] and the 1985â1997 [[Winston Million]], which awarded a million dollars to a driver who could win a &quot;small slam&quot; of the sport's four Grand Slam events in the same year. From 1998 to 2002, the [[Winston Million#Winston No Bull 5|Winston No Bull 5]], a more complex award system, was used. Each year, there were five races (initially the four majors and Indianapolis) selected to be a part of this promotion. Each driver who finished in the top 5 in the previous No Bull 5 race was eligible to win in the next race selected, along with a fan. If one of the eligible drivers won that race, they were awarded with a million dollar bonus.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
