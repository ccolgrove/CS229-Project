Cray even saves a wounded Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches [[Deadshot]] about the fact that Deadshot had murdered his father. Deadshot tells Cray that he would get one free shot at him. Soon after, on a mission, Cray is impaled through the chest by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
