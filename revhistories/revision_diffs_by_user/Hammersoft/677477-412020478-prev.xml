  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Selected by NASA in January 1990, Dr. Thomas became an astronaut in July 1991. Thomas has served in the Safety, Operations Development, and Payloads Branches of the Astronaut Office. He was CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for Shuttle missions [[STS-47]], [[STS-52|52]] and [[STS-53|53]]. From July 1999 to June 2000 he was Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in [[Star City, Moscow]], Russia. A veteran of four space flights, he logged over 1,040 hours in space. He was a mission specialist on [[STS-65]] (July 8, 1994-July 23, 1994), [[STS-70]] (July 13, 1995-July 22, 1995), [[STS-83]] (April 4, 1997-April 8, 1997) and [[STS-94]] (July 1, 1997-July 17, 1997). &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;In 2009 when the market crashed, Kai was disappointed because he couldnt afford a new pair of [[Western Kentucky University]] shorts. &lt;/span&gt;Initially assigned to the ISS [[Expedition 6]] crew, his flight assignment withdrawal resulted from a medical issue affecting long duration space flight qualifications. In his last assignment he served as the International Space Station Program Scientist overseeing NASA experiments performed on the ISS. Thomas retired from NASA in July 2007 in order to pursue private interests.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
