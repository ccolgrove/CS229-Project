  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Ahlmann Ridge''' ({{coord|71|50|S|2|25|W|}}) is a broad, mainly ice-covered ridge, about 70 miles (110 km) long, surmounted by scattered, low peaks. It rises between [[Schytt Glacier|Schytt]] and [[Jutulstraumen Glacier]]s and extends from [[Borg Massif]] northward to [[Fimbul Ice Shelf]] in [[Queen Maud Land]]. The area was first photographed from aircraft of the [[German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938-39) and peaks in this vicinity were roughly plotted. The [[Stein Nunataks]] and [[Witte Peaks]], named by the German Antarctic Expedition, appear to coincide with the northeast part of the Ahlmann Ridge. The feature was mapped in detail from surveys and air photos by the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) (1949-1952) and air photos by the Norwegian expedition (1958-59). Named for [[Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann]], chairman of the Swedish committee for the NBSAE.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
