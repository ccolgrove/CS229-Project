The shoes are sold in three different styles. The two most common are low-cut and mid-top. Nike also produces a high-top model, which is usually harder to find. The mid-top and high-top Air Force 1s come with a [[velcro]]-securable strap; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high-top's strap is movable and removable. Although the shoe comes in many different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1's sold are solid white (often referred to as &quot;white-on-white&quot;) and solid black &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;colours.the shoe's was also the first pair of trainers that notorious B.I.G brought and after that he sponsored them from then on.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another identifying characteristic of an Air Force 1 shoe is a small medallion that is secured to the bottom of the laces but has holes on either side so it can be removed by sliding it off of the shoe lace. The medallion is engraved with the inscription &quot;AF-1&quot;, with the year &quot;'82&quot; inscribed below it, and has historically been made out of a silver-colored metal (perhaps [[pewter]]). Its original design was more circular, but after a redesign for the Air Force 1's 25th anniversary in 2007 the medallion is now rectangular. (The redesign also involved encasing the inscription in white plastic; that was discarded in favor of the original medallion material.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
