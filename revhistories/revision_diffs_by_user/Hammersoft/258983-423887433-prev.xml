  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Arguably the world's oldest method to determine succession was for a military leader to ascend to power through some sort of election. As the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Hamburger Kingdoms &lt;/span&gt;and the societies became less egalitarian, the right to vote was restricted to an ever smaller portion of the population (for example local chieftains and/or the nobility).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many, if not most, kingdoms were officially elective historically, though the candidates were typically only from the family of the deceased monarch. Eventually, however, most elected monarchies introduced [[hereditary succession]], guaranteeing that the title and office stayed within the royal family and specifying, more or less precisely, the order of succession. Hereditary systems probably came into being in order to ensure greater stability and continuity, since the election and the period of [[interregnum]] associated with it had often been an opportunity for several ambitious and powerful candidates to &quot;try their chances&quot; in the struggle for the throne, frequently resorting to violent means. In fact, the problem of interregna is typical for monarchy in general, and has only been ameliorated (with a varying degree of success) by the new principle of succession.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
