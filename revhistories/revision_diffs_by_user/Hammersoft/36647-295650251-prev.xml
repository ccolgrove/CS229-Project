  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Encouraged to continue her career, she recorded a solo album, ''[[Christine Perfect (album)|Christine Perfect]]'', which she does not feel is among her better works. As Christine McVie, she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970, just after marrying Fleetwood Mac bass guitarist [[John McVie]]. She had already contributed backup vocals, played keyboards, and painted the cover for ''[[Kiln House]]''. The band had just lost founding member [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac, and since she knew all the lyrics to their songs, she went along. McVie quickly became an essential member of the group and the author of some of its finest songs, a position she would continue to hold for nearly 25 years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Furthermore, a group impersonating Fleetwood Mac was touring the [[United States]] without their permission. John McVie's [[alcohol]] drinking became unbearable, and Christine had an affair with a music producer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
