  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regarding migration of Indo-Aryans and imposing language on Harappans, Kazanas notes that &quot;The intruders would have been able to rename the rivers only if they were conquerors with the power to impose this. And, of course, the same is true of their Vedic language: since no people would bother of their own free will to learn a difficult, inflected foreign language, unless they had much to gain by this, and since the Aryan immigrants had adopted the âmaterial culture and lifestyleâ of the Harappans&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Allchins 1997: 223&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and consequently had little or nothing to offer to the natives, the latter would have adopted the new language only under pressure. Thus here again we discover that the substratum thinking is invasion and conquest.&quot; &quot;But invasion is the substratum of all such theories even if words like âmigrationâ are used. There could not have been an Aryan immigration because (apart from the fact that there is no archaeological evidence for this) the results would have been quite different. Immigrants do not impose their own demands or desires on the natives of the new country: they are grateful for being accepted, for having the use of lands and rivers for farming or pasturing and for any help they receive from the natives; in time it is they who adopt the language (and perhaps the religion) of the natives. You cannot have a migration with the results of an invasion.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;`The AIT and scholarship' by Kazanas  July 2001 Page 2,3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
