  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Damien&quot; included the first appearance of Satan, who would become a commonly recurring character throughout the series. The voice for Satan, provided by Trey Parker, was inspired by the voice of the [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] character at the ending of the 1992 horror movie, ''[[Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth]]'', when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, &quot;There's so many ways to go with him and we couldn't figure out the right one for a long time&quot;. The large and muscular look of the character stemmed from the fact that the script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Although Jesus had been introduced as a ''South Park'' character in previous episodes, &quot;Damien&quot; marked the first time he interacted with the main characters outside of his public access talk show, ''[[Jesus and Pals]]'' Parker said many viewers though the character was a crazy person who falsely believed he was Jesus, and he and Stone wanted to show in this episode that he was, in fact, supposed to be the actual Jesus.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
