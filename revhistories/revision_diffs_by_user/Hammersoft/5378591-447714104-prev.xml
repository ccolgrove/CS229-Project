  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rosemary and Alasdair soon left, possibly to another grand Sinclair home, while Grayson and Perdy became involved with village life. It appeared that Grayson and Perdy's marriage was on shaky ground following his infidelities and her inability to carry a baby full term.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At a recent shooting party at &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List of residences in Emmerdale#Home Farm|Home Farm]], &lt;/span&gt;Perdy suffered a miscarriage which turned out to be her sixth. After Rosemary found out, from the family doctor, she made a point of saying the lack of a child was a danger to the family name. Perdy, furious with Rosemary's cruelty, forced Grayson to find them a house away from Oakwell Hall, and the two moved into Mill Cottage, [[Rodney Blackstock]]'s old house. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rosemary, meanwhile, is hiding a huge secret from the rest of the family. She's broke and only her loyal servant, [[Susie Carter|Susie]], knows this. She got her claws into [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] in a bid to secure some financial backing, but didn't know that he, too, was broke and was using the Sinclair matriarch for exactly the reason. Rosemary is told that the Oakwell Hall has been one of her own family (Oakwells), for centuries. It has only once been owned by someone else, she meaning Lady Tara. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
