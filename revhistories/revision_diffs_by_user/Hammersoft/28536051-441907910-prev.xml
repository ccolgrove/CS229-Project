&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just after enjoying professional football life for few weeks, Berke Tinaz stated that he was not happy in Hatay.&quot;The city, even though my hometown, is too small and I can't have the same interest I had in the beginning&quot; he tells the reporters on a sunday morning. As soon as TFF Third League teams heard this very statement, they got into a race to sign Berke. &quot;Despite the fact that he is only 18 and highschooler and inexperienced, he has this great spirit which I think also helps him in his adult movies&quot; told an executive member of Menemenspor. He was extremely happy as Berke accepted their offer. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The same executive member was devastated after he got a call from Hamza, Berke's former team mate. Hamza told the executive member about Berke's infamous nickname. &quot;Keeping Berke on the team will definitely get the team success while competing in European Cups, but on the other hand will significantly decrease the morale of my team and people will question my moral principles as well.&quot; he said, trying to hold himself from crying. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wether those tear drops were a symbol of happiness or lament, Berke, seen from his social network accounts, was very happy about his transfer. His tweets reached 10 000 and he allocated a significant amount of space in Facebook servers. &quot;I have been hearing about these spammers all my career, but I never thought any spammer would be this serious.&quot; told Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook Inc. He also told a journalist that he may have to buy out Berke and abandon him to a life without any access to the internet.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
