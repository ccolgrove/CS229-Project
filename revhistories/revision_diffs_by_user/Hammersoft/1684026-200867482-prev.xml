  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instead, the pair decided to cover &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; (having rejected an earlier possibility, &quot;[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]&quot; by [[Bob Marley]]). In June 1985, Bowie was recording his contributions to the ''[[Absolute Beginners]]'' [[soundtrack]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]], and so Jagger arranged to fly in to record the track there. A rough mix of the track was completed in just four hours, at which point the pair went straight out to [[London Docklands]] to film a [[Music video|video]] with [[Music video director|director]] [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]. Thirteen hours after the start of recording, this also was completed. Jagger arranged for some minor musical [[overdubbing|overdubs]] in [[New York]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The video &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(featuring both stars hugging furiously, and sending each other up) &lt;/span&gt;was shown twice at the Live Aid event. Soon afterwards the track was issued as a single, with all profits going to the charity. &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; topped the UK charts for four weeks, and reached number seven in the United States. Bowie and Jagger would perform the song once more, at the Princes' Trust Concert on [[June 20]], [[1986]]. It is the last UK number-one single to date for Bowie, and the only number-one success for Jagger in his native country as a [[solo (music)|solo artist]]. The song has since featured on several Bowie [[compilation album|compilations]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although a hit at the time of its release, the record (as well as the rushed video) is not particularly popular today among either Bowie or Jagger fans.  Many Bowie, Jagger and rock fans in general often refer to this pairing as ''Ja-Bo'' (or JaBo) a derisive allusion to the saccharine media nick names for celebrity couples.  The term ''Ja-Bo'' was first coined by the popular rock music discussion blog, [http://www.rocktownhall.com Rock Town Hall] who in 2007 named this video [http://www.rocktownhall.com/blogs/index.php?title=rock_crimes&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;tb=1&amp;amp;pb=1 &quot;Rock Crime of the Century&quot;].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
