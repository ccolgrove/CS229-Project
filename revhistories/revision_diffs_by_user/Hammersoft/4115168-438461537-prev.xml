  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;T.K. and [[Kari Kamiya|Kari]] are in [[New York City]] taking a picture but are having trouble then Kari senses something. The attention turns to Willis and Terriermon, who engages in a battle with [[Wendigomon]], who keeps telling Willis to &quot;go back,&quot; and loses. Willis and Terriermon journey to Colorado while Kari e-mails [[Davis Motomiya]] to inform him of Willis. After taking planes and taxis, they end up meeting Willis in a truck while Kari and T.K. literally get derailed by Wendigomon. Willis tries to get Davis, [[Yolei Inoue]] and [[Cody Hida]] a lift to his house (in the form of a pizza truck). The ride leaves without Willis and Davis, who encounter Wendigomon which leads to a battle between him, [[Flamedramon]] and [[Gargomon]], Terriermon's Champion form. Before anyone is defeated, Wendigomon disappears, repeating his cryptic message, &quot;go back.&quot; Davis and Willis meet up with Yolei and Cody who told Davis that Kari And T.K. aren't here (to Davis's disappointment). Willis doubts that they'll come at all if Wendigomon interfered. After the kids question his knowledge about Wendigomon, Willis reveals he created him but regrets saying so and storms off, while being followed by Davis. Willis reveals the story about Wendigomon, how he became infected and reveals that he was the one who created Diaboromon. Davis offers to help with the rest of the kids and their Digimon. Terriermon overhears the conversation (blaming it on his &quot;really big ears&quot;) and offers to help. Willis refuses his help out of concern for his safety but Terriermon talks him into letting him. At Willis's lake, Wendigomon reappears, as expected, but digivolves to [[Antylamon]]. He swiftly evades the attacks of Gargomon, Flamedramon, [[Halsemon]] and [[Digmon]] and throws all the Digimon around like rag dolls. Antylamon sinks into the lake (and changes the scenery), and rises again, but as [[Kerpymon]]. He then de-digivolves all the Digimon. However, they still try to fight, but to no avail, as Kerpymon grabs them and is about to eat them when [[Angemon]] and [[Angewomon]] cut off his arms and T.K. and Kari show up. Kerpymon changes the scenery again and de-ages the Digidestined, revealing that he wanted Willis to &quot;go back&quot; in time to when the virus attacked him. Angewomon and Angemon digivolve to their Mega forms, [[Magnadramon]] and [[Seraphimon]], to release two [[Digi-Eggs|Golden Digi-Eggs]] for Willis and Davis. [[Veemon]] and Terriermon Golden Armor Digivolve to [[Magnamon]] and [[Rapidmon]] who get sucked into Kerpymon. Inside they see Wendigomon who tells them to destroy the virus. Doing so purifies Kerpymon, who soon dies. After saying goodbye to his new friends, Willis and Terriermon walk back home, and notice the Digi-Egg that will hatch into [[Conomon]], Kokomon's Fresh form.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
