  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Modern Islamic architecture has recently been taken to a new level with such buildings being erected such as the [[Burj Khalifa]], currently the world's tallest building. The Burj Khalifa's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower [[hymenocallis]] which is native to the Dubai region. Nature and flowers have often been the focal point in most traditional Islamic designs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
