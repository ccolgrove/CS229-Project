  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the fall of 1933, Gutmann applied for a veteran's war pension which was granted.  At this time, [[President of Germany|President]] [[Paul von Hindenberg]] had passed several verbal and written decrees allowing for the protection of Jewish war veterans from the rising tide of [[antisemitism]] in Germany.  In 1935, after the passing of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Gutmann lost his German citizenship and was formally discharged from the veteran rolls of the German Army.  He still continued to receive a pension, however, possible due to Hitler's influence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;According to the historian Werner Maser, Gutmann received, by Hitler's intervention, a pension from the Third Reich down to the end of the war.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
