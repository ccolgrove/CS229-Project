  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;He drives a [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] and is a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] (&quot;[[Fun Run]]&quot;). He is portrayed as an attentive and dedicated husband who is deeply in love with Phyllis. During the wedding episode, Phyllis mentions &quot;baby mama drama&quot; because Bob's other family from [[Ho Chi Minh City]] is coming in, but this has not been mentioned otherwise. In the 2nd episode of the Outburst webisodes, Oscar mentioned that Bob had been indicted by a grand jury. However, Phyllis states that all the charges were dropped after none of the witnesses showed up. In the episode &quot;[[Chair Model]]&quot; Bob and three other members of &quot;The [[Five Families]],&quot; W.B. Jones, Bill Cress and Paul Faust convene to resolve a dispute over the parking lot brought before them by Kevin and Andy.  In &quot;[[Goodbye, Toby]]&quot; Bob attends the going away party for Toby and in a deleted scene is shown giving Phyllis a large sum of cash so that her debut as head of the Party Planning Committee will be success.  In &quot;[[Crime Aid]],&quot; Bob attends Michael's auction intent on winning the [[Bruce Springsteen]] tickets, but after a spirited bidding war with Dwight, ends up buying a hug from Phyllis for $1000. In &quot;[[Blood Drive (The Office)|Blood Drive]]&quot;, he refers to Michael, Dwight, and Andy each as &quot;that jackass&quot;, &quot;that other jackass&quot; and &quot;that new jackass&quot; respectively. In &quot;[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]&quot;, Phyllis threatens to &quot;get Bob involved&quot; to resolve her Santa role rivalry with Michael. Jim is confused about what Bob would do at first, but appears mildly alarmed when Phyllis recants, &quot;Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
