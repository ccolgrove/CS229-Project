  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* [[Samus Aran]] from the ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' series of video games wears an exoskeleton, the Power Suit, designed by the [[Metroid (series)#Chozo|Chozo]] and enhanced with an attached arm cannon, which grants her the ability to roll into a ball around one meter in diameter and/or perform very high spinning jumps.  In addition, it allows her to survive almost indefinitely underwater, as well as in the vacuum of space.  The suit is modular in design, allowing the incorporation of additional weapons, detection equipment, movement enhancements, and protective shielding. Samus' flexibility and agility are possible due to her intense training and a special flexable underlayer. It also includes some biological components, as evidenced in ''[[Metroid Fusion]]''. Throughout the series, similar, if more primitive, armor is worn by Federation soldiers, Space Pirates, and other warriors within the universe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* The ''[[Fallout (computer game)|Fallout]]'' [[computer role-playing game]] series is notable for its use of powered armors in [[retro]]-[[1950s|'50s]] style. The first working version was the T-45d (deployed in 2067) which ran on conventional energy cells. The power consumption was so high however, that the later T-51b version (introduced in 2076) ran on an integrated TX-28 fusion reactor. The latter is said to be capable of absorbing a 2500 joule kinetic impact and the 10 micron ablative coating can reflect energy emissions such as lasers without damaging the surface. In addition, the suit runs on closed life support so that the wearer is nearly immune to radioactivity. Although its main users were Brotherhood of Steel Paladins, the Enclave performed extensive research and came up with an improved version made of lightweight metallic alloys with ceramic castings at key points. The design was later changed and the Mark 2 version (introduced in 2220) was made entirely of ceramics, becoming the standard issue armor for Enclave troops by 2277. Finally, the T45-d was the base for the MP-47/A prototype, which can administer morphine automatically, keeping the wounded soldier in battle condition until proper treatment can be administered.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

These crystals are the same type is to create an AI's core, and reside in between the armor and the inner body suit to allow him to override enemy electronic defenses.  The character is so heavily associated with the suit that he is never depicted outside of the armor, though at both the end of ''Halo'' and the start of ''[[Halo 2]]'', the Master Chief is helmetless, with his head offscreen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
