One of the reasons why Chadwick believed in improvement to public health was because he believed it would save money. He was born in [[Longsight]], [[Manchester]].  Called to the bar without any independent means, he sought to support himself by literary work such as his work on ''Applied Science and its place in Democracy'', and his essays in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' (mainly on different methods of applying scientific knowledge to the practice of government) brought him to the notice of [[Jeremy Bentham]], who engaged him as a literary assistant and left him a large legacy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
