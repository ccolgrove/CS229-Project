  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Luftwaffe gained significant combat experience in the [[Spanish Civil War]],  where it was used to provide close air support for infantry units. The success of the Luftwaffe's [[Ju-87 Stuka]] [[bomber aircraft|dive bomber]]s in the blitzkriegs that shattered Poland in 1939 and France in 1940, gave Berlin  inordinate confidence in its air force.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Military professionals could not ignore the effectiveness of the Stuka, but also observed that France and Poland had minimal effective air defense. Outside Britain, the idea of an integrated air defense system had not emerged; most militaries had a conflict between the advocates of [[anti-aircraft artillery]] and [[fighter aircraft]] for defense, not recognizing that they could be complementary, when under a common system of [[command and control]]; a system that had a [[common operational picture]] of the battle in progress.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
