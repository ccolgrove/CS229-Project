  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea became a leading producer of ships, including oil supertankers, and oil-drilling platforms. The country's major shipbuilder was Hyundai, which built a 1-million-ton capacity drydock at Ulsan in the mid-1970s. Daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in 1980 and finished a 1.2-million-ton facility at Okpo on Geoje Island, south of Busan, in mid-1981. The industry declined in the mid-1980s because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession. There was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late 1980s; new orders for 1988 totaled 3 million gross tons valued at US$1.9 billion, decreases from the previous year of 17.8 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. These declines were caused by labor unrest, Seoul's unwillingness to provide financial assistance, and Tokyo's new low-interest export financing in support of Japanese shipbuilders. However, the South Korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early 1990s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12311.html|title=South Korea: Shipbuilding|publisher=Library of Congress}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; South Korea eventually became the world's dominant shipbuilder with a 50.6% share of the [[Shipbuilding#World shipbuilding industry in the 21st century|global shipbuilding market]] as of 2008.
