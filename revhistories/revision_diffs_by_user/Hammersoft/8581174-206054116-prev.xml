  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The human-hawk Tobias has his morphing power back. He thinks about what the Ellimist had said, and laments that maybe he didn't want to be a human again. Tobias falls asleep, and wakes up in his old bedroom---the Ellimist apparently having sent him back in time to the night before he first met [[Elfangor]]. The &quot;past&quot; Tobias (human) wakes up, and the &quot;present&quot; Tobias (hawk) acquires his DNA before the past version falls back asleep. He also tells him to go to the construction site with Jake. As a result, he can morph his own human body for up to two hours at a time (or, as later books will point out, stay in human form forever---the Ellimist, in this way, was giving him a choice.) The next day, he shows up at school for Rachel's Packard Foundation Outstanding Student award ceremony, as a human, to Rachel's amazement.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
