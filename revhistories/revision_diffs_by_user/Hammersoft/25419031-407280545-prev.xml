She also was named the Most Valuable Player of the Daisies, after helping her team to win the regular season title with a 67-42 mark. But after an exciting series, [[Jean Faut]] led the South Bend club to win the Championship Title. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In that season, she was part of a Lassies All-Star slick infield that included [[June Peppas]] at [[first base]], [[Nancy Mudge]] at [[second base|second]], and [[Fern Shollenberger]] at [[third base|third]]. Meanwhile, the called ''Home Run Twins'', [[Chris Ballingall]] (17) and [[Carol Habben]] (15), powered the offense with 32 [[home run]]s; Peppas enjoyed a year career, and Kalamazoo advanced to the Championship Series. As a result, the Lassies defeated the Daisies in a best-of-five games series, with a decisive eight-inning RBI [[double (baseball)|double]] by Schroeder in Game 5, during what turned out to be the AAGPBL final season.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
