  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pigs are [[omnivore]]s, which means that they consume both plants and animals. Pigs will scavenge and have been known to eat any kind of food, including dead insects, worms, tree bark, rotting carcasses, garbage, and even other pigs. In the wild, they are foraging animals, primarily eating leaves and grasses, roots, fruits and flowers. Occasionally, in captivity, pigs may [[savaging|eat their own young]], often if they become severely stressed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A typical pig has a large head with a long snout which is strengthened by a special bone called the prenasal bone and by a disk of [[cartilage]] in the tip. The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very sensitive sense organ.  Pigs have a full set of 44 [[teeth]].  The canine teeth, called tusks, grow continually and are sharpened by the lowers and uppers rubbing against each other. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Ð¯ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ½Ð¾Ðº, Ð° ÑÑ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
