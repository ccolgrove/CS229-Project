  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' (1958) and [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' (1982) in addition to comic strips such as ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' (from 1937 onward).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|White|1958}}; {{Harvnb|Bradley|1982}}; {{Harvnb|Tondro|2002|p=170}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a [[feminist]] approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb |Lagorio|1996}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Lupack|Lupack|1991}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the [[Alan Jay Lerner|Lerner]]-[[Frederick Loewe|Loewe]] stage musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' (1960) and the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated film [[The Sword in the Stone (film)|''The Sword in the Stone'']] (1963); ''Camelot'' itself, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a [[Camelot (film)|film of the same name]] in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in [[Robert Bresson]]'s ''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'' (1974), [[Eric Rohmer]]'s ''[[Perceval le Gallois]]'' (1978) and perhaps [[John Boorman]]'s fantasy film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981); it is also the main source of the material utilised in the Arthurian spoof ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Harty|1996}}; {{Harvnb|Harty|1997}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
