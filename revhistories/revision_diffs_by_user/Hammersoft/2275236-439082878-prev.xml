Smooth-talking Richard whisks Gail off her feet, and they marry in 2002. Little does she know that her apparently perfect husband, due to financial difficulties, has become a serial killer to inherit money, murdering several Weatherfield residents and tries to kill others including Gail's mother, Audrey. When Audrey begins suspecting Richard, she tried warning Gail and urge her to phone the police, but Gail, believing her mother was suffering from dementia, as Richard had initially made everyone, including Audrey, believe. This led to them falling out and Gail cutting off contact with her mother when she continued to accuse Richard of being a murderer, much to Audrey's heartache. Also, while Gail was still oblivious to Richard's actions, Sarah was involved in a serious car crash with then boyfriend Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), after he steals [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]]'s ([[William Roache]]) car. Aidan escapes from the wreckage leaving Sarah trapped inside. Gail is devastated when Sarah is put on a life-support machine with her life hanging on the balance. Fortunately, Sarah wakes from her coma some weeks later and makes a full recovery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
