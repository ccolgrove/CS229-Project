Armstrong and Hensley were killed within the first 72 hours, but Bigley was kept alive for three weeks. The only Iraqi women prisoners being held at that time, according to the British government, were Taha and another woman scientist, [[Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash]], a bio-tech researcher who was on the [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|U.S. list of the 55 most wanted]] members of Saddam's regime.
