Though she is sometimes seen spending time with Lisa, other times she teases her along with the other children. She is not portrayed as being nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa.

In the episode &quot;[[Flaming Moe's]],&quot; Lisa and other girls play a party game with candle wax to predict the careers of their future husbands; Janey is dismayed to have her wax form the shape of a [[dustpan]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

His most distinguishing features are his ultra-low, gravelly voice and very long beard. Jasper made his first appearance in &quot;[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]&quot;. He is a veteran of [[World War II]], but (according to the episode &quot;[[Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play]]&quot;) he attempted to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman (though he retained his beard). He stayed in Springfield to play in the local women's baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war but was exposed during a game. In the parade scene of &quot;[[Lisa the Iconoclast]]&quot;, Jasper is seen in uniform, wearing a shoulder patch resembling that of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
