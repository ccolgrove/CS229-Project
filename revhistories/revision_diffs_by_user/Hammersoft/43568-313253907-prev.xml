  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hanks was born in [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[California]]. His father, Amos Mefford Hanks (born in [[Glenn County, California]] on March 9, 1924 &amp;amp;ndash; died in [[Alameda, California]] on January 31, 1992),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=Ancestry of Tom Hanks | url=http://www.wargs.com/other/hanks.html | publisher=wargs.com | accessdate=2009-05-12}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a distant relative of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], through Lincoln's mother, [[Nancy Hanks]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Fenster, Bob.

Hanks, Associate Professor] - [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Tom went with their father, while the youngest, [[Jim Hanks|Jim]], now an actor and film maker, remained with his mother in [[Red Bluff, California]]. Afterwards, both parents remarried. The first stepmother for Sandra, Larry, and Tom came to the marriage with five children of her own. Hanks once told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': &quot;Everybody in my family likes each other. But there were always about 50 people at the house. I didn't exactly feel like an outsider, but I was sort of outside it.&quot; That marriage ended in divorce after just two years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Amos Hanks became a single parent, working long hours and relying on the children to fend for themselves often, an exercise in self-reliance that served the siblings well.  In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, telling ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: &quot;I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.&quot; In 1965, Amos Hanks married Frances Wong, a [[San Francisco]] native of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] descent.  Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Tom during his [[high school]] years. Tom acted in school plays, including ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', while attending [[Skyline High School (Oakland, California)|Skyline High School]] in [[Oakland, California]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hanks studied theater at [[Chabot College]] in [[Hayward, California]], and after two years, transferred to [[California State University, Sacramento]]. Hanks told ''[[The New York Times]]'': &quot;Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat, and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and all that, and now look at me, acting is my job. I wouldn't have it any other way.&quot; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was during his years' studying theater that Hanks met [[Vincent Dowling]], head of the [[Great Lakes Theater Festival]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the Festival, which stretched into a three-year experience that covered everything from lighting to set design to stage management. Such a commitment required that Hanks drop out of college, but with this under his belt, a future in acting was in the cards. Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance as [[Proteus]] in Shakespeare's ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', one of the few times he played a villain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
