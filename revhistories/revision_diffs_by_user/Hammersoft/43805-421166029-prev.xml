  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;'''im a bannana''' &lt;/span&gt;is the practice of making accusations of disloyalty, subversion, or treason without proper regard for evidence. The term has its origins in the period in the United States known as the [[Red_Scare#Second_Red_Scare_.281947.E2.80.9357.29|Second Red Scare]], lasting roughly from the late 1940s to the late 1950s and characterized by heightened fears of [[Communism|communist]] influence on American institutions and [[espionage]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents. Originally coined to criticize the [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] pursuits  of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]], &quot;McCarthyism&quot; soon took  on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as [[Demagogy|demagogic]] attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the McCarthy era, thousands of Americans were accused of being Communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and [[Trade union|union]] activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was often greatly exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment, destruction of their careers, and even imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;For example, ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957) and ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'' (1957): Fried (1997), pp. 205, 207.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; laws that would be declared unconstitutional,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;For example, California's &quot;Levering Oath&quot; law, declared unconstitutional in 1967: Fried (1997), p. 124.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; dismissals for reasons later declared illegal&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
