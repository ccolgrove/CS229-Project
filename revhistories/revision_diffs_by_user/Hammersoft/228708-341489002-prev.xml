  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The hostage-taking appears to be uncoordinated, with different groups making various demands. Some hostages are released whilst others are killed, sometimes by beheading. Several kidnappings have been claimed by the [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] (The Unity of God and Holy War) Islamist group, which changed its name to &quot;Al-Qaeda in Iraq&quot; in October 2004. The group was ran by the Jordanian-born Palestinian [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]. The hostages who have been beheaded by Zarqawi's group, and possibly by Zarqawi himself, include Americans [[Nick Berg]], [[Eugene Armstrong]] and [[Jack Hensley]], South Korean [[Kim Sun-il]], [[Shosei Koda]] from Japan, and [[Kenneth Bigley]] from the UK. Italian [[Fabrizio Quattrocchi]] was shot in the head, possibly by another group, as was British aid worker [[Margaret Hassan]]. According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], at least 25 [[journalists]] have been kidnapped by armed groups in Iraq since April 2004, when insurgents began targeting foreigners for abduction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
