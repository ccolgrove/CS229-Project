He is the son of [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], who defected to the United States to collaborate with Tony Stark's [[Howard Stark|father]] only to be fired by him, deported back to the [[Soviet Union]], and forced to live in exile. Constructing an arc reactor-powered suit of his own with the aid of his father's blueprints, Ivan Vanko attacks Tony Stark with two electrified whips during the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco]]. Stark defeats him using a portable Iron Man suit, and Vanko is sent to prison. Later, Vanko escapes from prison with the help of Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]]; hoping to upstage Stark and secure his own commercial enterprise, Hammer has Vanko build a battalion of military drones to present at the Stark Expo. At the presentation, Vanko gains remote control over both the drones and the [[War Machine]] armor worn by Jim Rhodes, directing them to attack Iron Man. Rhodes regains control of the War Machine suit, and he and Iron Man team up to defeat the drones and Vanko. In a last ditch effort to kill Stark, Vanko activates self-destruct mechanisms in the Hammer drones and in his own, heavily upgraded suit of armor. The bombs explode, leveling the Stark Expo, while Stark and Rhodes manage to escape.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
