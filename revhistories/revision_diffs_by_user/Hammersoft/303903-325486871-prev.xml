  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is presumed that the nickname &quot;[[Miners]]&quot; came from the fact that the school was founded as the &quot;State School of Mines and Metallurgy.&quot; In doing research on this project, early mention of &quot;Ore Diggers&quot; and &quot;Muckers&quot; for the nickname was found, but nothing to determine if the name &quot;Miners&quot; was voted upon by the student body, or if a faculty member, John W. (Cap) Kidd, chose the name. Kidd was a big booster of athletics, especially football, and in 1915, when funds were rather lean at the school, Kidd donated $800 to equip the football team. He also assisted with coaching, although he was not the head coach. The present track facility on campus bears Cap Kidd's name. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;The coolest kidfuck no at UTEP is Sammy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
