  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;FCB (which is pronounced &quot;Eff Tsay Bay&quot; in [[Swiss German]]) was most successful in the 1960s and 1970s winning the Swiss championship seven times (1967, 1969, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1977, 1980) and the national Cup three times (1963, 1967, 1975). They also won the League Cup in 1973 and the [[Coppa delle Alpi]] consecutively in 1969 and 1970. In those days, they were a dominant force in Switzerland and they were major competitors in Europe also. In the 1980s they had to play in the Nationalliga B (the second highest League in Switzerland). They had fallen away and were only a shadow of the Basel team from the 60s and 70s. In 1994, they were promoted back into the Nationalliga A (the highest League) and have since proved that they belong there by winning numerous league titles and cups, not to mention their successful campaigns in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Cup]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
