  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Monk Parakeet is the only parrot that builds a stick [[bird nest|nest]], in a tree or on a man-made structure, rather than using a hole in a tree. This [[social animal|gregarious]] species often breeds colonially, building a single large nest with separate entrances for each pair. In the wild, the colonies can become quite large, with pairs occupying separate &quot;apartments&quot; in nests that can reach the size of a small [[automobile]]. These nests can attract many other tenants including birds of prey such as the [[Spot-winged Falconet]] (''Spiziapteryx circumcincta''), ducks such as the [[Speckled Teal]] (''Anas flavirostris''), and even [[mammal]]s. Their 5-12 white eggs hatch in about 24 days.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
