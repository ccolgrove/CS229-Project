  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the battle, there was controversy as to the identity of the Marine who planted the flag in the famous photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima.  When his mother saw [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s iconic flag raising photograph in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, &quot;That's Harlon&quot;, pointing to the figure on the far right.  However, [[Rene Gagnon]] mistakenly identified the figure as Sergeant [[Hank Hansen]] of [[Boston]], another Paramarine who was involved in the first flag-raising earlier that day, but who was not included in the famous photograph.  [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]] concurred with Gagnon at that time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
