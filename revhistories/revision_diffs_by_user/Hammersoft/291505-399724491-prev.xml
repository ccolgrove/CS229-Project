  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Montgomery Blair High School, then known as Takoma-Silver Spring High School, became the first high school to serve [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] when it opened in 1925 with 86 students. The {{convert|3.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus was located at the corner of Philadelphia Avenue and Chicago Avenue in suburban [[Takoma Park, Maryland]]. By the end of the 1920s the school had expanded to host students in eighth and ninth grades, who attended the school's [[middle school|junior high school]], as well as tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades, who attended the school's [[high school|senior high school]]. As Silver Spring and Takoma Park continued to rapidly grow, the school eventually encompassed all levels from kindergarten to twelfth grade. By 1934, the school was over-capacity with a total enrollment of 450 students, and so, in September 1935, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades relocated to a new high school named Montgomery Blair Senior High School, also known as the Wayne Avenue Campus. During the transition period, students, teachers, and administrators had to commute between the two campuses, and collectively began creating some of the new traditions that would be the foundation for Montgomery Blair High School, among them the annual yearbook, Silverlogue. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
