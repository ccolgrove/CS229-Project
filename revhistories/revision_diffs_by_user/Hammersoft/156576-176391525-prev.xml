  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Ebenezer Scrooge''' is the [[main character]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' [[1843]] novel, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. He is a very cold-hearted, selfish man, who has no love for Christmas, children, or anything that even resembles happiness. A quote from the book reads &quot;The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue, and he spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice ...&quot; His last name has come into the [[English language]] as a byword for [[miser]]liness and [[misanthropy]], traits displayed by Scrooge in the exaggerated manner for which Dickens is well-known. The story of his transformation by the three Ghosts of Christmas ([[Ghost of Christmas Past|Past]], [[Ghost of Christmas Present|Present]], and [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Yet to Come]]) has become a defining tale of the [[Christmas]] holiday in some cultures. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Ebinezer Scrooge was very mean to the children who were caroling at his house , he did not like christmas spirit in his office too. &lt;/span&gt;Scrooge's phrase, &quot;Bah, [[humbug]]!&quot; has been used to express disgust with Christmas traditions in modern times. The inspiration for Charles Dickens' character was a grave marker for an Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie.
