  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a list of characters from the television show, [[Beast Machines]], the sequel to [[Beast Wars]]. The show is part of the [[Transformers]] franchise, based around alien robots transforming into animals and vehicles. Beast Machines follows on from the ending of Beast Wars, featuring the surviving heroes, the Maximals returning to their homeplanet of [[Cybertron]] to find it enslaved by the evil Predacon-Vehicon leader, Megatron. The characters are split into two battling factions, the Maximals and Vehicons. Some characters, although part of teams, are neutral.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Beast mode is a technorganic [[gorilla]]. He was the first to transform into his new robot mode. Optimus is the stalwart and brave leader of the Maximals during the ''Beast Wars''. His leadership degrades however, as his fanaticism to defeat Megatron grows. This is apparent when he nearly gets the team killed during a battle against Vehicons in a factory. He blames himself for the current state of [[Cybertron]] and also for the loss of his comrades, [[Rhinox]] and [[Silverbolt]]. Upon discovering [[Tankor]] was [[Rhinox]], Optimus made a choice to allow Rhinox to carry out his own goals, but that was a mistake he would realize later on. Optimus soon discovered the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]] to challenge Megatron's control over the Key to [[Vector Sigma]]. Tankor manipulates both but Megatron knew of Tankorâs treachery and in the end, Tankor, Megatron and Optimus all perish in a panicked attempt to conquer each other. Optimus is later reborn with help from his friends and the Matrix. Becoming his old self again, he leads the Maximals to victory against Megatron, claiming his base and the sparks of Cybertron. Eventually, Optimus is the only &lt;/span&gt;Maximal &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;left standing when the Vehicons capture the others in the series finale. Megatron takes on the body of Optimal Optimus and battles Optimus, using the Key to Vector Sigma to neutralize the planet's core. However, Optimus uses his power of the Oracle to attack Megatron and the two plunge into the core of Cybertron, acting as catalysts to reformat the entire planet into a technorganic paradise. Optimus is last seen by Cheetor in an Oracle vision ascending into the Matrix, his mission finally complete. Optimus could absorb incoming energy blasts and fire it right back at his attackers. He could also fire energy shurikens from his chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Cheetor is now second-in-command of Maximals, but still looks up to Optimus as his mentor. However, the two can get into heated arguments when either of them make rash decisions. Cheetor's new beast mode allows him to move much faster than before and he can easily confuse a Vehicon drone (as seen in ''Reformatting''). Cheetor was one of the four Maximals to appear on Cybertron with no memory of what happened before even though he hears the words of Optimus Prime's spirit before he disappeared to the stars. Cheetor survives the ''Beast Machines'' war and appears to become the leader of the Maximals, and the Oracle's new representative as Optimus was previously. Cheetor's weapons included an enhanced super speed (to the point of the original Transformers' Blurr) and a pair of sabers, which he pulled from his back. The sabers could be used to deflect incoming energy blasts, could be thrown as boomerangs and attached at the hilt to form a glider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She eventually frees him from his evil form [[Jetstorm#Beast Machines|Jetstorm]], but he is bitter about his revival. In the end, Blackarachnia and Silverbolt are properly reunited.

She has a pair of stingers which she could use to deliver powerful blasts of bioelectrical energy.

Wisecracking spy Rattrap appeared on Cybertron with no memory of how he got there, and hid aboard a cargo vehicle until he was discovered by Optimus, unable to transform like the gorilla. He is the last out of the original four Maximals to learn how to transform, because he was impatient, but he discovered his short wheeled robot mode has no weapons. He nearly became a [[Vehicon]] to get weapons from Megatron and out of bitterness at his vastly diminished position within the Maximals due to his comparatively weak form. He soon, however, realized his mistake and rejoined the Maximals. Rattrap soon learned he could access the computers of Cybertron and gain secret information. Near the end of the series, Rattrap fell in love with fellow Maximal, [[Botanica]]. Rattrap had no direct weapons to speak of, hence part of a character flaw, but he had a visor that he could use to scan his peripheral environment and use his onboard computer systems to hack other computer systems. He also has a built in toolbox located in his back which he can use to build various gadgets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
