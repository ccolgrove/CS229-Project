  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is '[[BrÃ¼no (character)|BrÃ¼no]]', a flamboyantly [[gay]] Austrian fashion show [[presenter]], who often lures his subjects, unwittingly, into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. BrÃ¼no asks the subjects to answer 'yes or no' questions with either &quot;Vassup&quot; (whats up), or &quot;Ich don't think so&quot; (No), or sometimes &quot;Ach, ja!&quot; (Ah ha!) or &quot;Nicht, nicht&quot; (&quot;Nicht&quot; means &quot;not&quot; in German). In one segment on ''Da Ali G Show'' he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either &quot;Keep them in the ghetto&quot; or &quot;Train to Auschwitz&quot;. BrÃ¼no's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and clubbing world. In May 2009, at the MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as 'BrÃ¼no' wearing a white angel costume, a white jock strap, white go-go boots and white wings, and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto [[Eminem]], Cohen landed on his lap and his rear in Eminem's face, prompting [[Eminem]] to exit the venue with fellow rappers D12 (staged as a malfunction, Eminem was in on the gag with Cohen and even rehearsed it, as exposed about a week after the show).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
