  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the [[United States]], player/managers and player-coaches were once common, especially in the early days of [[baseball]]. The last player-manager in [[Major League Baseball]] was [[Pete Rose]], who began managing the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1985, the second-to-last season of his playing career. [[Ty Cobb]],  [[Cap Anson]], [[Joe Cronin]], [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]], [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], [[Tris Speaker]], [[Frank Robinson]], [[Joe Torre]] and [[Lou Boudreau]] all spent time as player-managers. In this capacity, Robinson became the first [[African-American]] manager in Major League Baseball (for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1975).  [[Fred Clarke]] (Pittsburgh NL) spent the longest time as a player-manager. Major league rules are somewhat different for trips to the mound by the manager if he is a player-manager (this is with regard to being required to change pitchers), and a player-manager puts himself into or out of the lineup just like any other player.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
