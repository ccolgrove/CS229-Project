  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spider-Man's web-shooters were perhaps his most distinguishing trait, after his costume. Peter had reasoned that a spider (even a human one) needed a web.  Since the radioactive spider-bite did not initially grant him the power to spin webs, he had instead found a way to produce them artificially.  The wrist-mounted devices fire an adhesive &quot;webbing&quot; (see below) through a threaded adjustable nozzle.  The trigger rests high in the palm and requires a double tap from the middle two fingers to activate, eliminating the chance of accidental discharge when forming a fist.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;''Amazing Fantasy'' #15&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  To accomplish this his hands are often in a distinctive hand position when he fires them (resembling the sign for &quot;I love you&quot; in [[American Sign Language]], reverting someone giving you the &quot;Evil Eye&quot; in Italian superstition or the [[horned hand]] heavy-metal gesture).  In order to fire the webbing, Spider-Man's fingers must hit the sensor precisely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
