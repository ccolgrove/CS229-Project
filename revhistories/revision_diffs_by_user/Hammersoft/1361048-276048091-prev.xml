  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although best known for his work in costume dramas, Sewell prefers &quot;[[cravat]]-less&quot; roles in modern pieces, such as the role of [[Petruchio]] in the [[BBC]]'s 2005 version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''. This was shown as part of the ''[[ShakespeaRe-Told]]'' season, and the role earned him a Best Actor nomination at the 2006 [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Television Awards]]. In this modern retelling of the story the action moves from 17th Century [[Padua]], [[Italy]] to 21st Century [[London]]. This production marked the fourth time that Sewell had acted in a work based on a Shakespeare play since becoming a professional actor: he previously portrayed [[Hotspur]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' in 1995, [[Fortinbras]] in ''[[Hamlet (1996 movie)|Hamlet]]'' in 1996 and the title role in ''[[Macbeth]]'' in 1999. The role also reunited him with his Charles II co-star Shirley Henderson. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
