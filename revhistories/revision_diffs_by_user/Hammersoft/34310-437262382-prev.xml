  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The University is represented in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] by the [[York Lions]]. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the &quot;[[Yeomen]]&quot;, after the [[Yeomen Warders]], the guardians of the fortress and palace at the [[Tower of London]], otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name &quot;Yeowomen&quot; was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a &quot;Yeowoman&quot; was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the University replaced both names with the &quot;Lions&quot;, as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the &quot;York Lionesses&quot;, even though the name &quot;Lion&quot; is intended to apply to both sexes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.universitysport.ca/e/story_detail.cfm?id=397 Canadian Interuniversity Sport].
