  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;David Tapp was a detective assigned to investigate early Jigsaw crimes. Evidence led him to suspect Dr. Lawrence Gordon of being Jigsaw and led him to a possible hideout for Jigsaw. Tapp and his partner Sing found the real Jigsaw and attempted to arrest him but were stopped when the killer activated a nearby trap, threatening the life of the man trapped within it. Sing rushed to help the victim while Tapp attempted to arrest Jigsaw but Jigsaw retalliated by slicing open Tapp's throat. As they pursued Jigsaw, Sing was killed in a booby-trap for which Tapp blamed himself. As he became obsessed with capturing Jigsaw, Tapp was dismissed from the force. Still convinced that Gordon was Jigsaw, Tapp investigated him privately, inadvertently coming into conflict with Zep Hindle who was holding Gordon's family hostage. Tapp gave chase and fought with Zepp but was shot and left for dead. In ''[[Saw (video game)|Saw: The Video Game]]'', it is revealed that Tapp was nursed back to health by Jigsaw and placed in a series of traps in an asylum, forced to overcome tests and other victims sent to kill him. In the game's &quot;Freedom&quot; ending, Tapp manages to escape the asylum but commits suicide sometime afterwards by shooting himself in the head in his apartment because he could not overcome his obsession with Jigsaw. In the game's &quot;Truth&quot; ending, Tapp becomes insane and is sent to an asylum. In ''[[Saw V]]'', Tapp is given a police memorial.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
