  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the break-up, Weasel and Jughead formed a new band called [[The Gore Gore Girls(male)|The Gore Gore Girls]], and Ben briefly performed in the original incarnation of [[The Vindictives]].  In 1991, the members of Screeching Weasel reunited for what was intended as a one-off gig to pay off debts the band incurred from the recording of ''[[Boogadaboogadaboogada!]]''. The line-up consisted of Ben, Jughead, Vapid, Vermin, and Ward. After the show, Dan Vapid discussed the idea of reforming Screeching Weasel with Jughead. All of the band's members agreed to reform, with the exceptions of Brian Vermin and Douglas Ward (who, presumably, was not invited). To replace Vermin, drummer [[Dan Panic]] (Dan Sullivan) was brought in. Before recording their next album, 1991's ''[[My Brain Hurts]]'' (for [[Lookout! Records]]), Ben Weasel decided he wanted to focus on singing and would no longer be playing guitar in the band. Vapid switched instruments from bass to guitar, and former Gore Gore Girls bassist Dave Naked joined the band. The recording sessions for the album also produced the ''[[Pervo-Devo]]'' EP.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
