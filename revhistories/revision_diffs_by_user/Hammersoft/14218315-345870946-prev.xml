  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Benton is a former murderer/movie director that has become a [[zombie]]. He and his partner, Erroll Von Volkheim, would pose as ordinary movie producers to lure unsuspecting victims to their fates, killing twelve people in the process. Eventually, they were jailed for their crimes. However, von Volkheim was released from jail for good behavior, while Tarantella died in prison (possibly executed). He first appears at the Bagges' house claiming he wants them to be in a movie he's making, but tricks them into filming a fake movie only to resurrect von Volkheim in order to devour Muriel together, who is cast in the film as a [[human sacrifice]]. Their weakness was that they follow the script to the &quot;movie&quot;, even after Courage modified it. They, frustrated, decided to give up their plan and end their partnership. Tarantella returns on his own and casts the Bagges and Courage in a TV show called ''Angry Nasty People'', and is eventually defeated and apparently killed when Courage drops him in &quot;instant [[quicksand]]&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
