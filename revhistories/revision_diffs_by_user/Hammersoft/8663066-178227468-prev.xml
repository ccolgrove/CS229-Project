Even though he was very young, he was well-liked and respected by the other heads of the founding families. As a leader, he was wise beyond his years and never made any rash decisions. Most of the time, he remained composed, but he did show tears for Aya and Midoriâs deaths. He miscalculated how difficult killing SÅhaku was and was forced with the other founding families to agree to a truce. The remainder of his days were spent defying SÅhaku by hunting down those with special powers, in order to stop the Resonance Effect. This goal led to the creation of a highly detailed plan to wipe out all the Red Feathers; this plan wasn't carried out for centuries as some of the required elements have just now come together.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She had the power to create illusions and make a realistic, fully controllable copy of herself as an adult, with the help her beetles. She is depicted as having quite the mean streak, especially when it concerned her teammate IchiyÅ. Some of her unkind behavior was misleading, as it was later exposed that she actually was treating the frostbitten feet of a peasant girl with Samurai hat and not just hurting her. She managed to kill SÅhaku's body while his powers were nullified by Senhime, like IchiyÅ planned, but was also killed by him with her own dagger. Before dying, she mistook Ayaâs presence with IchiyÅ and said she was happy for helping him at least once in her life and that she would be going ahead of him.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Lastwords&quot;&amp;gt; &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; Manga; volume 16 [[tankÅbon]] (Chapter 94, Page 23). &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

His power gives him the ability to copy someone else's appearance and change others as well. His power also allows him to read their ki, so he could copy their physical techniques. After the death of his friend and teammate, he begins to wear Myouunâs skull necklace as a remembrance. After the raid, he takes the appearance of an older SÅhaku, who is believed to be dead. The presumption is proved to be false, because two years later, Noriko took out one of his eyes and replaced it with SÅhakuâs. Since SÅhakuâs consciousness was stored in that eye, Tokuanâs body was taken over. Sohaku taking over Tokuan's body cut off the Shojo bloodline, indicating Tokuan likely had no siblings or children. Tokuan is therefore the last true Shojo family member. A Shojo branch family took on the name, and inter-married relatives to bring their power closer to the original Shojo family's power.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
