  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The war also profoundly affected Few's attitude toward the political future of the new nation, transforming the rugged frontier individualist into a forceful exponent of a permanent union of the states. Men of his stripe came to realize during the years of military conflict that the rights of the individual, so jealously prized on the frontier, could be nurtured and protected only by a strong central government accountable to the people.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Descendant of Quaker shoemaker, Richard Few of Whiltshire England, and his son Isaac Few, a cooper, who emigrated to [[Pennsylvania]] in the 1680s, the Fews lived in northern [[Maryland]], where they eked out a modest living raising tobacco on small holdings. When a series of droughts struck the region in the 1750s, the Fews and their neighborsâactually a sort of extended family consisting of cousins and distant relationsâfound themselves on the brink of ruin. The whole community decided to abandon its farms and try its luck among the more fertile lands on the southern frontier.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The group ultimately selected new homesites along the banks of the [[Eno River]] one mile from Hillsborough in [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]], [[North Carolina]], first in what is now [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] (but was then Orange County), and later east of [[Hillsborough, North Carolina|Hillsborough]], in Orange County. Here young Few developed the skills expected of the eighteenth-century farmer.In an account of the early history of Orange County, Francis Nash wrote, &quot;His father [William Few, Jr.s] though, belonged to the better class of farmers, had more means and a better education than the average settler.&quot;  Such a life left little time for formal schooling, although the community hired an itinerant teacher for a brief time in the 1760s. From this experience Few obtained a rudimentary education that led to a lifelong love of reading. Essentially a self-educated man, Few also found time to read law and qualify as an attorney despite a full-time commitment to the unrelenting demands of agricultural toil.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In time the Few family achieved a measure of prosperity, emerging as political leaders in rural Orange County. Like many other western settlers, however, the family became involved with the [[Regulators]], a populist movement that grew up in reaction to the political and economic restrictions imposed on the frontier or backcountry farmers by the merchants and planters of the tidewater area and by the local politicians and lawyers. By 1771 protest had become confrontation, and a large group of mostly unarmed westerners gathered to clash with North Carolina militia units at the &quot;battle&quot; of the [[Alamance]]. The uneven fight ended in total victory for the militia, although most of the Regulator's demands for political representation and economic relief eventually would be met by the state legislature. More immediately, one of Few's brothers -- [[James Few]] -- was hanged for his part in the uprising, and the Few family farm just east of [[Hillsborough, North Carolina|Hillsborough]] was ransacked by Tryon's militia troops. The rest of the family fled to [[Wrightsboro]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], leaving Few behind to settle their affairs and sell their property.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Few participated in this training as one of the first men to enlist in the volunteer militia or &quot;minute men&quot; company formed in Hillsborough. Typically, Few's unit received its tactical instruction from a veteran of the colonial wars, in this case a former corporal in the British Army who was hired by the company as its drill sergeant. Citing the press of family business, Few rejected the offer of a captaincy in one of the first units North Carolina raised for the [[Continental Army]] in the summer of 1775. But when he finally settled the family's accounts the next year and joined his relatives in Georgia, where he opened a law office, he quickly placed his newly acquired military knowledge at the service of the Patriot cause in his new state.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
