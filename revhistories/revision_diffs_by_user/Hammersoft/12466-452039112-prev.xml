Following a defeat of his forces at the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|Battle of Reading]] on 9 December, James and his wife fled the nation; James, however, returned to London for a two-week period that culminated in his final departure for France on 23 December. By threatening to withdraw his troops, William in February 1689 convinced a newly chosen [[Convention Parliament]] to make him and his wife [[joint monarchs]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
