Nickelodeon official Albie Hecht, Drymon, Hillenburg, Julia Pistor, and Gina Shay produced the film, while much of the film's music was composed by Gregor Narholz.Originally,this movie was going to be the series finale,but because of the film's popularity and universal critical acclaim,Stephen Hillenburg decided to make more episodes. The film follows SpongeBob, who expects to be bestowed the title of manager for Mr. Krabs' new restaurant, the ''Krusty Krab 2'' (although this restaurant is never seen or mentioned for the rest of the series). However, the position is given to Squidward instead, causing SpongeBob to go into a state of depression. Jealous of Mr. Krabs' success, Plankton initiates his final plan, ''Plan Z'', which involves framing Mr. Krabs for the theft of King Neptune's crown. SpongeBob and Patrick then go on a quest to retrieve Neptune's crown and save the lives of both Mr. Krabs and the rest of Bikini Bottom from Plankton's scheme. The film also guest stars [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as King Neptune, [[Scarlett Johansson]] as the king's daughter Mindy, [[Alec Baldwin]] as Dennis the Hitman, and [[David Hasselhoff]] as himself.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Johansson&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite video | people=[[Scarlett Johansson|Johansson, Scarlett]]|date=2005|title= The Absorbing Tale Behind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.
