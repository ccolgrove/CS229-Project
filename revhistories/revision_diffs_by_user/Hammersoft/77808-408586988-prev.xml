  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In September 2002, Disney Channel was gradually remodeled once more. First, the &quot;Zoog&quot; brand name was phased out from on-air usage; the &quot;Zoog&quot; name continued under a separate website until 2003, when it was merged with Disney Channel's main website. Then on September 9, 2002, the Vault Disney block was discontinued (primarily to contribute to the network's new &quot;hip&quot; image) in favor of same-day repeats of the channel's original programming and [[television syndication|off-network series]]. Primetime movies were also cut to one each night (from two). The channel also ceased producing drama and reality series, shifting focus to live-action comedies and animated series; the  logo on the right was implemented a month later. As a result of these changes, of the three blocks introduced in 1997, only Playhouse Disney continues to this day (though the block will be rebranded as [[Playhouse Disney#Disney Junior|Disney Junior]] in February 2011). Around the same time, Disney Channel partnered with corporate sister [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to run the channel's programming on [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC's Saturday morning block]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
