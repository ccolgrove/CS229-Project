As a compromise to settle matters between the ex-couple over issues of alimony payments for their adopted son, Gaye's attorney until his death, Curtis Shaw, advised Gaye to remit a portion of the revenue that he was to get for his next studio album. Gaye entered the recording studio intending to produce a &quot;lazy&quot; album, but ended up with the sprawling double-album set, ''[[Here, My Dear]]'', which was held up from release for over a year. Finally released after Motown's demand for new product in late 1978, the album was initially a flop, tanking after only a couple months on the charts. Its only single, &quot;[[A Funky Space Reincarnation]]&quot;, peaked at number twenty-three on the R&amp;amp;B chart, in early 1979, becoming Gaye's first single since &quot;Soldier's Plea&quot; 17 years earlier to not hit the Billboard Hot 100.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gaye became a figure on talk show circuits for most of 1979, mostly appearing on [[Dinah Shore]]'s ''[[Dinah &amp;amp; Friends]]''. He also toured in 1979, first in the United States, then in England and in Japan, the latter being the first time (and, as it turned out, the only time) he ever toured that country. As the year continued, Gaye found himself in trouble financially, and at home with second wife, [[Janis Gaye|Janis Hunter]]. The couple split up in 1979, nearly eighteen months after marrying, and by that fall, following a performance in Hawaii, Gaye decided to remain in the state, fearing he might be imprisoned for failing to pay the [[IRS]] millions in back taxes; in court, his attorney claimed that several items within the singer's luggage, including tax returns, were stolen from him while at an airport. Meanwhile, Gaye, now heavily in the throes of [[drug addiction]], struggled to record. Reports stated that while in Hawaii, Gaye lived inside a bread truck. He initially had planned to release a standards album titled ''[[Vulnerable (Marvin Gaye album)|The Ballads]]'' but discarded it, fearing fans would be disappointed by no recognizable hits on it. The singer then intended to release an album of love songs aimed for the [[disco]] audience titled ''[[In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)|Love Man]]'', but within a year, however, Gaye thought of expressing his feelings about a possible [[Armageddon]], as well as his battles of the heart. Gaye changed the titles of all the songs, rewrote lyrics, and retitled the album, ''In Our Lifetime?'', recording the album tracks while living in London in the middle of his exile.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
