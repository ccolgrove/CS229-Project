Taylor pulled Theismann down and his hip swung over and landed on Theismann's lower right leg, fracturing both the [[tibia]] and the [[fibula]]. Giants linebackers [[Gary Reasons]] and [[Harry Carson]] then joined Taylor in the sack.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The compound fracture of the tibia led to insufficient bone growth during Theismann's recovery, leaving his right leg shorter than his left.
