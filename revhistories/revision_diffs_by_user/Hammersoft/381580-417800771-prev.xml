It was considered that this afforded Eircom an opportunity to re-enter the mobile communications market. On 9 July 2005 it was reported by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' that there had been three bidders for Meteor: Eircom, [[Smart Telecom]], and a consortium led by [[Denis O'Brien]]. On 14 July 2005 [[RTÃ News]] reported on their [http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0714/meteor-business.html business website] that Denis O'Brien had withdrawn from bidding, and that it was understood that Eircom was the top bidder at â¬410 million. On 21 July it was announced that Smart Telecom had also withdrawn, leaving Eircom as the sole bidder. Eircom announced the agreement to purchase it on 25 July 2005 at a cost of â¬420m.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0725/eircom-business.html |title=RTÃ Business: Eircom mobile again, but shares drop |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2005-07-25 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
