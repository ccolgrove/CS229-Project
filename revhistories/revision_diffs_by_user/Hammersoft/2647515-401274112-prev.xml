  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On February 25, 2010 SpaceX's first flight stack was set vertical at Space Launch Complex&amp;amp;nbsp;40, Cape Canaveral,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.spacex.com/updates.php |title= Updates |date=February 25, 2010 |work= |publisher= SpaceX | accessdate= 2010-06-04 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and on  March 9, SpaceX performed a static fire test, where the first stage was to be fired without taking off.  Some fire and smoke were seen at the base of the rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire.  However, all components checked out, but the test executed a nominal abort at T-2&amp;amp;nbsp;seconds due to a failure in the spin-start system.  This system is designed to pump high pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps to get them spinning in preparation for launch.  Subsequent review showed that the failure was a valve that didn't receive a command to open.  As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't occur at the McGregor test site, which didn't have the same valve setup.  No damage was sustained by the vehicle or the test pad and the fire and smoke were the result of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch.  All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing.  A subsequent test on March&amp;amp;nbsp;13 was successful in firing the nine first-stage engines for 3.5&amp;amp;nbsp;seconds.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
