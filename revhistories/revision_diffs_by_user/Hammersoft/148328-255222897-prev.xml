  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cube released ''[[The Predator]]'' in November 1992, which had been recorded amidst the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|LA uprising]] of 1992. Referring specifically to the riots, in the first single, &quot;Wicked&quot;, Cube rapped &quot;[[Los Angeles riots of 1992|April 29]] was power to the people and we might just see a sequel&quot;. ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&amp;amp;B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included &quot;[[It Was a Good Day]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Check Yo Self]]&quot; remix, and the songs had a two part [[music video]]. The album remains Cube's most successful release, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Cube's rap audience slowly began to diminish. ''[[Lethal Injection]]'' which was released in the end of 1993 and represented Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including &quot;[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Know How We Do It]]&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;What Can I Do?&quot;. After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, such as [[Mack 10]], and [[Mr. Short Khop]].&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
