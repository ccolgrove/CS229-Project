  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tejano music was born in Texas. Although it has influences from Mexico and other Latin American countries, the main influences are American. Contemporary classic Tejano artists such as Emilio and Raulito Navaira, [[David Lee Garza]] and [[Jay Perez]] exhibit influence from [[Rock (music)|rock]], [[blues]], [[funk]], and [[Country music|country]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is important to understand that Tejano music has various categories of music and bands. Three major categories are '''[[Conjunto]]''', '''Orchestra''' and '''Modern'''. A Conjunto band is composed of accordion, ''bajo sexto'', bass, and drum. Examples of Conjunto Bands are [[Esteban &quot;Steve&quot; Jordan]], [[The Hometown Boys]] and [[Jaime de Anda y Los Chamacos]]. An Orchestra consists of bass, drum, electric guitar, synthesizer, and a brass section on which it relies heavily for its sound. It can also have an accordion in the band at times. An example of an Orchestra is [[Ruben Ramos and the Texas Revolution]], [[The Liberty Band]] and [[The Latin Breed]]. A Modern Tejano band consists of synthesizers, drums, electric guitar, bass and at times an accordion. It relies heavily on the synthesizer for its sound.  Modern bands are La Mafia, Selena and her band Selena Y Los Dinos, [[Shelly Lares]], Jay Perez, and Jimmy Gonzalez Y [[Mazz]]. Other categories consist of Progressive, Pop and Urban Tejano music. All of these categories are classified as Tejano.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
