  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Royals began operations with General Manager [[Cedric Tallis]], who soon developed a reputation as the best trader in the league. The first big trade was with fellow expansion team [[Seattle Pilots|Seattle]], which brought in 1969 [[MLB Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] [[Lou Piniella]].  In their inaugural game, on April 8, 1969, the Royals defeated the [[Minnesota Twins]] 4-3 in 12 innings.  Two pitching stars from the [[Baltimore Orioles]] team that won the [[1966 World Series]] pitched for the Royals in the inaugural game: [[Wally Bunker]] threw the franchise's very first pitch, and [[Moe Drabowsky]] won the game in relief.  After finishing the season in  5th place, the Royals' next trade cemented a reputation as a speedy team.  Third baseman [[Joe Foy]] was traded to the [[New York Mets]] for speedy outfielder [[Amos Otis]], who would become the Royals' first star.  Further one-sided trades brought to the Royals second baseman [[Cookie Rojas]], bullpen ace [[Ted Abernathy]], shortstop [[Fred Patek]], first baseman [[John Mayberry]] and left fielder [[Hal McRae]]. The Royals also invested in a strong farm system and in the early years developed such future stars as pitchers [[Paul Splittorff]] and [[Steve Busby]], infielders [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] and [[Frank White (baseball player)|Frank White]], and outfielder [[Al Cowens]].  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
