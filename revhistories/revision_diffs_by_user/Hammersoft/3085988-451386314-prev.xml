  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The '''history of [[BBC]] television idents''' begins in the early 1950s, when the BBC first displayed a logo between programmes to identify its service. As new technology has become available, these devices have evolved from simple still black and white images to the sophisticated full colour short films seen today. With the arrival of digital services in the United Kingdom, and with them many more new channels, branding is perceived by broadcasters to be much more important, meaning that idents need to stand out from the competition.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
