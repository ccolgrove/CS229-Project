The script was adapted slightly from the novel; the scene in the novel of where Red gives a reefer to his fourteen-year old son (played by real-life son Kyle) was not approved by Eastwood and altered and the ending was also changed to the playing on the radio of a song written by Red on his death bed, shortly before his burial.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.344&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The film was shot in the summer of 1982 within six weeks.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.345&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The first part of the movie was filmed in [[Bird's Landing, California]], although the majority of this feature was filmed in and around [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras County]], east of [[Stockton, California]]. Exterior scenes include Main Street, [[Mountain Ranch, California|Mountain Ranch]]; Main Street, [[Sheepranch, California|Sheepranch]]; and the Pioneer Hotel in Sheepranch.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fourth ''Dirty Harry'' film ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' (1983), is widely considered to be the darkest, &quot;dirtiest&quot; and most violent film of the series. This would be the last time he starred in a film with frequent leading lady [[Sondra Locke]]. The script, written by [[Joseph Stinson]], is about a woman (Locke) who avenges the [[rape]] of herself and her sister (now a vegetable) by a ruthless gang at a fairground. The woman systematically murders her rapists one by one, shooting them once in the genitals and once in the head. Pat Hingle and [[Bradford Dillman]] also starred alongside Eastwood and footage was shot in the spring and early summer of 1983. The line, &quot;[[Go ahead, make my day]]&quot;, uttered by Eastwood during an earlier scene in which his regular morning cafe is threatened by robbers, is often cited as one of cinema's immortal lines and was famously referenced by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in his campaigns. The film was the highest earning of all the Dirty Harry films, earning $70 million and received rave reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGilligan (1999), p.352&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
