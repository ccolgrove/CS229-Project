  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]]. While in the original position, persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of [[distributive justice]] in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/ &quot;Distributive Justice&quot; at SEP] Retrieved December 18, 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
