  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Much of Klarwein's most famous work is inspired by [[surrealism]] and [[pop culture]], but also reflects his interest in non-Western deities, symbolism, and landscapes. The alleged connection between Klarwein and the so-called [[psychedelic]] art of the period is not entirely unfounded, as he has detailed his experience with LSD in his 1988 book ''Collected Works''; however, Klarwein also explains that drugs were never his prime inspirational source,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mati Klarwein: Collected Works 1959-1975; Harmony Books, New York, Â©1988&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and in one interview, denies their influence entirely. His extensive travels and wide interests (notwithstanding the fact that his style had fully developed before the &quot;psychedelic era&quot;) are further support of his claims.  Klarwein claims that his friend Timothy Leary once told him, based on the character of his paintings, that Klarwein &quot;didn't need psychedelics.&quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20070807204534/http://www.levity.com/mavericks/mati.htm Internet Archive: Mati Klarwein Interview&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
