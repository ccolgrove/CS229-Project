An underline below the ''Loving'' title was used in both title and closing sequences during this period.

The short sequence cut and the longer, complete version used in the closing sequence, was written and composed by [[Michael Karp]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;For a brief few months in late 1987 into early 1988, the closing credit crawl appeared in transparent white, without the use of black shadowing. Soon after [[Joseph Hardy]] replaced Joseph Stuart in the spring of 1988, there were other minor cosmetic changes. The title sequence now featured a chime-like sound effect during the 4-6 second mark, as the pink outline of the show's title met the white display of it. The closing sequence also went from playing out mimed scenes to featuring a series of stills from that day's episode, a change made by Hardy five years earlier on ''Ryan's Hope'', upon taking the helm of that series. The crawl, which now had its black shadowing reinstated, moved the writing staff back from the left side of the screen to the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;centeoriginal old-fashioned, &quot;classic&quot; image. Nearly a year into his arrival, this shift included the show's theme song and visuals as well. On March 27, 1989, a new theme package debuted on ''Loving''. The new theme was a full orchestral piece sung by [[Johnny Mathis]], and was written by composers Bob Israel, [[Michel Camilo]], and Bobby Daye. This was accompanied by visuals of charcoal and pastel paintings of couples in love. The sequence begins with a glass version of the iconic ''Loving'' logo moving gingerly toward the screen, at the bottom, over a replica of a religious painting of two boy and girl infant angels showing affection. This view proceeds into a series of paintings which chronicle one couple's romance throughout a single lifetime. The paintings overlapped each other while glass letters of the ''Loving'' logo flew over them (one at a time), and were the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

First, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] moved Joseph Hardy over to ''General Hospital'' in late November 1989, replacing him with veteran daytime producer and future ''[[The Real World]]'' creator/producer [[Mary-Ellis Bunim]]. Bunim, however, only served four months as the show's EP before abruptly leaving. In April 1990, former ''All My Children'' producer Jacqueline Babbin took over. Although she agreed to only stay on for a year, Babbin decided to make some noticeable adjustments of her own, which eventually included the ''Loving'' theme package. After just less than two years, the Mathis theme was retired on February 1, 1991.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The last scene is a silhouette of the man and woman holding hands, and then embracing, over a sunset sky visual, while the ''Loving'' logo flashes to the center of the screen, with the font clear and transparent. The dramatic, yet somewhat soothing theme music, which featured piano and synthesizers, was composed by David Randall Lowe and David M. Shapiro. The visuals overall, and the new age theme song that accompanied it, were later seen as a preview of the similar &quot;New Age&quot; visuals of ''[[One Life to Live]]'', which ran from January &lt;/span&gt;1992 &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;to November 1995. While this ''Loving'' theme package was still running when ''OLTL'''s new package debuted, it would be gone a month later--due to the fact that Jacqueline Babbin was replaced with new EP Fran Sears in July 1991, with Sears wanting to implement different visuals of her own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On February 4, 1991, new opening visuals premiered, composed of a series of videotaped, live-action shots of a couple's romance. These shots include a man feeding a strawberry into a woman's mouth, a shattering wine glass, the man placing a ring on the woman's finger, etc. Every scene is taped with dark-colored backdrops, each with a different color, and only the portions of the man and woman's faces and hands are revealed. Some scenes transition with freeze-framed shots of the action(s) in a small square graphic, which fades out as the next shot begins. The last scene is a silhouette of the man and woman holding hands, and then embracing, over a sunset sky visual, while the ''Loving'' logo flashes to the center of the screen, with the font clear and transparent. The dramatic, yet somewhat soothing theme music, which featured piano and synthesizers, was composed by David Randall Lowe and David M. Shapiro.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The cut of Lowe/Shapiro ''Loving'' theme used in the title sequence was the only length produced, so during the closing credits a continual loop of the :30 theme was used, with the ending notes of the tune meshing into the beginning notes over again each time. Some episodes even played the theme in a slower pitch, in order for it to not loop as much. The graphic changes that occurred in the closing credits during the previous theme package, along with the long-running Goudy Bold setup, remained in place for another year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
