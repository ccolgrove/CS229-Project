  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The idea for the original Ironman Triathlon arose &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;when Fouad decided to warm up &lt;/span&gt;during the awards ceremony for the 1977 [[Oahu]] Perimeter Relay (a running race for 5-person teams). Among the participants were numerous representatives of both the Mid-Pacific Road Runners and the Waikiki Swim Club, whose members had long been debating which athletes were more fit, runners or swimmers. On this occasion, [[U.S. Navy]] Commander John Collins pointed out that a recent article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine had declared that [[Eddy Merckx]], the great Belgian cyclist, had the highest recorded &quot;[[VO2 max|oxygen uptake]]&quot; of any athlete ever measured, so perhaps cyclists were more fit than anyone. CDR Collins and his wife Judy Collins had taken part in the triathlons staged in 1974 and 1975 by the San Diego Track Club in and around [[Mission Bay, California]], as well as the 1975 Optimist Sports Fiesta Triathlon in [[Coronado, California]]. A number of the other military athletes in attendance were also familiar with the San Diego races, so they understood the concept when Collins suggested that the debate should be settled through a race combining the three existing long-distance competitions already on the island: the [[Waikiki]] Roughwater Swim (2.4&amp;amp;nbsp;mi./3.86&amp;amp;nbsp;km), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (115&amp;amp;nbsp;mi./185.07&amp;amp;nbsp;km; originally a two-day event) and the [[Honolulu Marathon]] (26.219&amp;amp;nbsp;mi./42.195&amp;amp;nbsp;km). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Until that point, no one present had ever done the bike race. Collins calculated that by shaving {{convert|3|mi|km}} off the course and riding counter-clockwise around the island, the bike leg could start at the finish of the Waikiki Rough Water and end at the [[Aloha Tower]], the traditional start of the Honolulu Marathon. Prior to racing, each athlete received three sheets of paper listing a few rules and a course description. Handwritten on the last page was this exhortation: &quot;''Swim 2.4 miles! Bike 112 miles! Run 26.2 miles! Brag for the rest of your life''&quot;, now a registered trademark.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
