  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus then turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a one hour show named ''The Decision'' on [[ESPN]] that he would be signing with the [[Miami Heat]]. The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. A couple of LeBron James jerseys were burned, and the famous Nike &quot;Witness&quot; mural of James in downtown Cleveland was taken down. Shortly after James made his announcement, Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, announced in an open letter on the Cavaliers website that James' decision was a &quot;cowardly betrayal&quot; and promised a NBA championship for the Cleveland Cavaliers before LeBron James wins one. Despite being ridiculed for the letter by the media, Cleveland fans embraced the owner, even offering to pay the $100,000 fine given by the NBA.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
