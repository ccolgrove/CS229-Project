  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Despite setting Michigan's all-time rushing recods, Morris' small size (5 feet, 7 inches) led to his not being selected until the fourth round of the [[1988 NFL Draft]] by the [[Washington Redskins]].  He played three seasons from [[1988 NFL season|1988]]-[[1990 NFL season|1990]].  His best year was 1988 when he played in all 16 games for the Redskins, and rushed for 437 yards in 126 attempts.

With no hope of returning to the playoffs, the Redskins gave Morris what amounted to an audition for the starting job in 1989.
