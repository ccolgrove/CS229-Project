  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cordes started for the Lassies in Game 2, which featured seven home runs by both teams. Due to a mix-up over the game's starting time the [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] did not allow Cordes to warm up (supposedly there would be a half hour delay). Starting cold, she allowed five runs before getting a batter out. After a leadoff walk to [[Mary Weddle]], Horstman belted a home run for a 2-0 Fort Wayne lead. Then Richard and Weaver hit back-to-back [[single (baseball)|singles]], and [[Betty Foss]] followed with a three-run homer to give the Daisies a 5â0 edge. Roth relieved Cordes and completed the game. But the Lassies hit three more home runs, one each by Geissinger and Weaver and the second for Foss. Kalamazoo discounted the margin with leadoff shots by [[Nancy Mudge]], Peppas (playing at [[first base]]) and [[Dorothy Schroeder]], but the game's outcome was never in doubt.&amp;lt;ref name=SABR-Sargent/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In the decisive seventh inning, Peppas added a base hit to spark a three-run Kalamazoo rally, capped by a Ballingallâs two-run single.
