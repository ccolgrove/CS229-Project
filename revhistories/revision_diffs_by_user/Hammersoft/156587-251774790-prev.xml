He starts at school the same time as [[Sirius Black]], [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Potter family#James Potter|James Potter]]. All four are sorted into [[Gryffindor]], form a group of friends called the &quot;Marauders&quot;, of which each learns to (illegally) become an [[Animagus]] (except Lupin who was a werewolf). Pettigrew's Animagus form was a [[rat]], from which he acquired the nickname '''Wormtail'''. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort's spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters are to be placed under the [[Spells in Harry Potter#(Fidelius Charm)|Fidelius Charm]], Sirius (the obvious candidate for Secret-Keeper) suggests the Potters use Pettigrew instead. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that ultimately leads to James and Lily's [[death]]. After their death, Sirius realises Pettigrew must have betrayed their hiding place, and, going after the latter, corners him on a busy street. During the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potter's deaths, kills twelve [[Muggles]], and then cut off his own index finger before turning into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for his own [[murder]] and that of the bystanders. This deception results in Sirius' imprisonment in Azkaban, while Pettigrew is &quot;posthumously&quot; awarded the Order of Merlin. Pettigrew hides during the next years, masquerading as '''Scabbers''', [[Ron Weasley]]'s pet rat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
