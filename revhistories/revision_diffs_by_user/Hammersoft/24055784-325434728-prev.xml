  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Itâs 1980 and eleven-year-old Moon Blake ([[Jimmy Bennett]]) has spent most of his life hiding out in the forests of Alabama with his father, an anti-government radical who clings to conspiracy theories and trusts no one.  Moonâs life suddenly changes when the land is sold to a lawyer and his father dies. He has never known any truth but his Papâs and so he tries to follow his last instructions; make your way to Alaska where &quot;people could still make a living off trapping.&quot;  Moon quickly finds himself in the path of civilization, when lawyer Mr. Wellington ([[John Goodman]]) discovers him on his land.  Thinking he is doing what is best for the boy, he calls the local authorities. Moon bolts fearing the very thing he has been hiding from his entire life.  Unfortunately, he is captured by the mean-spirited Constable Sanders ([[Clint Howard]]), who takes him to a boyâs reform school to become property of the State. Here Moon meets other boys his age and learns what friendship is all about.  However, Moon is determined on getting to Alaska and escapes from the school bringing two of his friends Kit ([[Uriah Shelton]]) and Hal (Gabriel Basso) back to the forest to live with him. Moon uses his wilderness survival skills to outwit Constable Sanders and provide food and shelter for him and his friends. Moon writes smoke letters to his Pap, letting him know he is ok. However, Moon begins to question his father's beliefs when Hal leaves and Kit gets gravely ill and is in need of medical attention.  As Moon encounters other lifestyles, true friends and true enemies, he adapts and learns to survive in the outside world, and even, perhaps, make his home there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
