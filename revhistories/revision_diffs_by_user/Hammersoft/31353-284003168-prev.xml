  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by [[Alan J. W. Bell]], which first aired on [[BBC Two]] in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First through Sixth. A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey, that would have come from Adams's abandoned ''Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen'' project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell and/or Geoffrey Perkins involved are all offered as causes), and the second series was never made. The elements of the ''Doctor Who and the Krikketmen'' project instead became the third novel, ''Life, the Universe and Everything''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
