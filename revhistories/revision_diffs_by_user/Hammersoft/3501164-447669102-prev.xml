Cain and Sadie plotted a [[Major Storylines of Emmerdale#Tom King.2C Cain Dingle and Sadie King Kidnap Plot 2006|kidnap of Tom King]] for a large ransom. Sadie knew nobody would believe Cain was capable of murder so they planned to fake her death so Tom would co-operate. However, things didn't go to plan. Debbie took great pleasure in telling Cain that Sadie had paid for Jasmine's abortion, leaving Cain heartbroken and furious. After a violent confrontation with Sadie, Cain followed her to the meeting place regardless. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

After hiding in a barn for a night, Cain returned to the village and was confronted by Chastity. Cain denied knowing anything about Tom and Sadie's disappearance and left. When the police began closing in on his hideout, Cain took them to an abandoned factory, switched cars and donned a disguise reminiscent of [[Mr. Magoo]]. However, the police followed him to a quarry where Cain sidetracked them by sending his empty car over a cliff, making everyone think Tom and Sadie were inside. While the police searched the lake, Cain assaulted two policemen and disguised himself in a police uniforms. After &quot;shooting&quot; Sadie, Cain forced Tom to phone [[Chastity Dingle|Chas]] to deliver the ransom. This was also the last time he saw Debbie. Debbie begged her father to take her with him, even suggesting she get Sarah back but they parted in tears. Cain gave some of the ransom to an old lady, asking her to post it to Debbie. Cain was surprised by her honesty and realised he wanted to change. At the airport, Cain got into the plane alone, telling Sadie that he didn't want to be the same person he'd always been.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
