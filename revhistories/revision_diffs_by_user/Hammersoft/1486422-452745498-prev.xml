Reese was inspired by Hershey, so he left the dairy farm to start his own candy business. '''The H. B. Reese Candy Co.''' was established in the basement of Reese's house in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.hersheyarchives.org/ Hershey Community Archives]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and used Hershey chocolate in his confections. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were his most popular candy, and Reese eventually discontinued his other lines. Several years after his death, Reese's company was sold to The Hershey Company, then known as Hershey Foods Corporation, in [[1963]] for $23.5 million. The H.B. Reese Company is maintained as a subsidiary of Hershey because the Reese plant workforce is not unionized, unlike the main Hershey plant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
