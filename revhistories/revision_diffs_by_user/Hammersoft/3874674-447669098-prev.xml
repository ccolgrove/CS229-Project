  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In March 2009, [[Jamie Hope]] asked Betty to make a batch of [[chutney]] to send to [[Louise Appleton|Louise]] in [[Australia]]. Betty obliged, and spent hours making several jars. The following day, while cleaning at &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[List of residences in Emmerdale#Home Farm|Home Farm]] &lt;/span&gt;she was tired, and [[Nathan Wylde]] told Natasha that Jamie had made a delivery of chutney. Betty had a funny turn, dropping a vase in the process. She took one jar of chutney and saw that Jamie had put a label on, replacing hers. Betty decided to get revenge on Jamie and Bob, who was also in on it, recalling the chutney she had made, saying Alan was ill because of the batch she had made the previous night. Betty said she would make another batch, making a disgusting alternative. She gave it to Jamie, who took it to Home Farm. Nathan unwittingly tasted a spoonful and had to rush to the sink because of its foul flavour. Natasha then went to the Woolpack and shoved a spoonful into Jamie's mouth, warning him not to pull a stunt like that again. Betty admitted what she had done, and wanted free tea and cakes in the cafÃ© as compensation. However, [[Rodney Blackstock]] pointed out that she may have missed an opportunity with the Wyldes, but Betty eventually made an arrangement with Natasha and she produces chutney under the Home Farm brand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
