When she returned to singing, Aretha decided to secure herself a deal as a pop artist. After being offered contracts from [[Motown Records|Motown]] and [[RCA Records|RCA]], Franklin signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1960. Her recordings during that time reflected a [[jazz]] influence and moved away from her gospel roots. Franklin initially scored a few hits on Columbia including her version of &quot;Rock-A-Bye Your Baby (With A Dixie Melody)&quot;, which peaked at number 37 on the Billboard [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles chart]] in 1961, and the Top 10 R&amp;amp;B hits, &quot;Today I Sing The Blues&quot;, &quot;Won't Be Long&quot; and &quot;Operation Heartbreak&quot;. However, by the end of 1966, with little commercial success in six years with Columbia and desperate for a sound of her own, she accepted an offer to sign with [[Atlantic Records]]. According to Franklin years later, &quot;they made me sit down on the piano and the hits came&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
