  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the 1968-69 season the Saint-Germain based club, reached the quarter finals of the  [[Coupe de France 1968-69|French Cup]], where they faced eventual champions, [[Olympique de Marseille]]. The first leg took place at the [[Parc des Princes]] and the second leg at the [[Stade VÃ©lodrome]]. The match saw the logic triumph of l'OM (2-0 and 5-1). It was an encounter that had driven the Parisian public out of hiding, as they played amid a crowd of just over 14,500 spectators. The following year brought even more success as the club finished third in the CFA, thus gaining promotion to the second division. But all this success couldn't mar the fact that [[Paris]], the capital city of France, didn't have a renowned team. Teams from other major cities had successful and historically prestigious clubs, such as [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[AS Saint-Ãtienne|Saint-Ãtienne]], and Marseille. The lack of Parisian based teams were apparent to see, mainly in fact between the two world wars, famous clubs like [[Club FranÃ§ais]], [[Olympique de Paris]], [[CA Paris-Charenton|CA Paris]], all had disappeared from the French footballing spectrum. Only [[Red Star Saint-Ouen|Red Star]], remained in the first division, and they were marooned at the bottom of the table, and the only other Parisian teams of note was the second division outfits, Paris-Jonville and Paris-Neuilly - but even they were more obscure with no real ambitions or means to gain a decent fan base or reputation.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
