  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;January 1, 1986 was not only the beginning of a new year, but also the date of one of the most famous riots in recent history.  The West Virginia Penitentiary was then undergoing many changes and problems.  Security had become extremely loose in all areas. Since it was a &quot;cons&quot; prison, most of the locks on the cells had been picked and inmates roamed the halls freely.  Bad plumbing and insects caused rapid spreading of various diseases.  The prison was now holding more than 2,000 men and crowding became an issue once again.  Another major contribution to the riot's cause was the fact that it was a holiday.  Many of the guards had called off work, which fueled the prisoners to conduct their plan on this specific day.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
