  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A typical and very famous Bochner role was that of the scheming [[Cecil Colby]] on ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'', in part due to his notorious death scene (the character suffered a heart attack while having sex with [[Alexis Colby|Alexis Carrington]] ([[Joan Collins]]), and later died in his hospital bed seconds after marrying her). A few years later, Bochner planned to star as C.C. Capwell on the daytime drama ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', but a heart attack caused his departure from the series. Bochner continued to appear in television series for the next few decades, doing frequent voiceover work for the animated cartoon version of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. In 1998 Bochner co-founded the Committee to End Violence, a panel designed to study the impact violent images had on culture. He was also active in Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists and was a licensed amateur radio operator.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
