Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that ultimately leads to James and Lily's death. Sirius sought revenge on Pettigrew but, during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accused Sirius of the Potters' deaths, murdered twelve nearby Muggles, and then cut off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as of his own murder and that of the bystanders.
