A brilliant strategist and tactician, he was a man deeply respected and accorded (nearly) unquestionable authority. Even though his decisions at time seemed high-risk, his experience never failed him. The fact that he and ''J.T.

Yet, there were moments of weakness, as he failed to notice the fires of Mutiny growing on his ship and the fleet. Winfield's advanced age meant he was periodically indisposed due to illness and/or injury, an occurrence the incompetent Captain Marcus never failed to take full advantage of. Therefore, at the war's end, the Admiral retired from the Exofleet with full honors to build a [[horse]] [[ranch]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In episode 2.23, he is promoted to the rank of ''Wing Commander'' and henceforth has two units under his command, Able and Baker Squads, while ''Lt. Nara Burns'' becomes the new leader of the former. Over the years, J.T. Marsh has proven himself as a man whom people will follow - even being the most famous and successful exosquad leader of the Exofleet, he remained a modest, attentive and likable person. In fact, the only one who has ever truly hated him was ''Phaeton'', the leader of Neosapiens, - as well as the only one who was equal to him in hand-to-hand combat (except the [[Neosapien#Neo Lords|Neo Lords]]), which clearly demonstrates Marsh's battle skills. One of his regular tactics in a space battle was to go for the enemy flagship, especially the well-defended [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], thus, [[decapitation|decapitating]] the opposing fleet. Over the time, Marsh has developed a mutual tender relationship with ''Colleen O'Reilly'', a Lieutenant of the [[#Jumptroops|Jumptroop Platoon]]. As the series progressed, it was revealed that Marsh was at one time as rebellious and gung ho as Yuri Stavrogan and Kaz in his youth, the first episode alluded to this when he disobeyed orders and went on a joy run with his squad in the canyons on Mars. Clearly, fighting against the Neosapiens served to remind Marsh of his duties and the nature of war itself. During the war, Marsh piloted a ''&quot;Falcon&quot; #AA-500 E-frame''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Ironically enough, despite being the least experienced (albeit still talented) exotrooper, Nara Burns was the one to fire the last, and perhaps the most important, shot in the Neosapien War - the one that killed ''Phaeton'', despite the fact that he was dying anyway. Over the years, she developed a deep relationship with ''Marsala''; the final episode (meant to be the first of the third season) implies that she has fallen in [[love]] with him, although she also displayed an interest in the young pirate Hallas.

Kaz's E-frame, a ''#CR-001 Exofighter'', was the only one in the squad that was incapable of ground combat, therefore he usually stayed in the air to provide aerial support and to scout the surroundings. A brilliant space pilot, Kaz Takagi deeply respected all fellow Able Squad members and especially regarded ''Wolf Bronsky'' as his mentor and his closest friend. He devoped a strong friendship and rivalry with fellow Exofleet pilot Yuri Stavrogan, though Marsh disproved of the friendship as he felt that Yuri encouraged Kaz's reckless behavior. After the end of the war, ''Wing Cmdr. Marsh'' sent him to the ''Exofleet Academy'' &quot;to learn some discipline&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

He was an expert in everything regarding battle and [[morale]] - weapons, E-frames, communications, even [[battle cry|war cries]]. A perfect soldier and a great leader, he was to the Jumptroops what ''J.T. Marsh'' was to the exotroopers - when Butler spoke, Charlie-Five Squadron listened. Before any given jump-landing Butler would always line up his troopers and demand whether there are &quot;any [[hero]]es&quot; among them (the answer is always negative), clearly demonstrating his [[wikt:realism|realistic]] views of war and combat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
