Both works have major characters who work in finance:  Marshall's [[protagonist]] is an [[accountant]] while NÃ©mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a [[bank]].  Both books were written during and/or immediately after the events in question, but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works, but fiction featuring invented characters.  The stories cover the leadup to the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion]] and its immediate aftermath, but the events of the respective stories are much different.  Marshall's ends before the [[occupation]], while NÃ©mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
