  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next major change to the core is with its memory bus. [[Radeon R420|R420]] and R300 had nearly identical memory controller designs, with the former being a bug fixed release designed for higher clock speeds. R520, however, differs with its central controller (arbiter) that connects to the &quot;memory clients&quot;. Around the chip there are two 256-bit ring buses running at the same speed as the [[DRAM]] chips, but in opposite directions to reduce [[RAM latency|latency]]. Along these ring buses are 4 &quot;stop&quot; points where data exits the ring and going into or out of the memory chips. There is actually a fifth stop, one that is significantly less complex, designed for the [[PCI Express]] interface and video input. This design allows memory accesses to be far quicker though lower latency by virtue of the smaller distance the signals need to move through the GPU, and by increasing the number of banks per DRAM. Basically the chip can spread out memory requests faster and more directly to the RAM chips. ATI claims a 40% improvement in efficiency over older designs. Again, the smaller cores such as RV515 and RV530 receive cutbacks due to their smaller, less costly designs. RV530, for example, has two internal 128-bit buses instead. This generation has support for all recent memory types, including [[GDDR4]]. In addition to ring bus, each memory channel now has the granularity of 32-bits, which improves memory efficiency when performing small memory requests.&amp;lt;ref name=TechReportX1000series /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The vertex shader engines were already of the required [[Floating point|FP32]] precision in ATI's older products. Changes necessary for SM3.0 included longer instruction lengths, dynamic flow control instructions, with branches, loops and subroutines and a larger temporary register space. The pixel shader engines are actually quite similar in computational layout to their R420 counterparts, although they were heavily optimized and tweaked to reach high clock speeds on the 90 nm process. ATI has been working for years on a high-performance shader compiler in their driver for their older hardware, so staying with a similar basic design that is compatible offered obvious cost and time savings.&amp;lt;ref name=TechReportX1000series /&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
