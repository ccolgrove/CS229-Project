  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Casey Novak was SVU's Assistant District Attorney (Seasons 5â9), who replaced ADA Alex Cabot. Although she quickly loses her innocence when dealing with [[sex crime]]s, she still shows uneasiness when dealing with the gray areas of human involvement, preferring the letter of the law to the messiness of each individual reality. Nonetheless, Novak has a 71 percent success rate in the cases she prosecutes, whereas the average for prosecutors is 44 percent. After initial hesitation, she becomes particularly close to Stabler as they bond over being [[Catholic]] and a love for sports. It is revealed that in her final year of law school, Novak was engaged to a man (Charlie) who suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. She ended the relationship when his symptoms became so severe she felt she could no longer be intimate with him. In 2002, Charlie attacked her in her home during a [[psychotic episode]]. She convinced the police not to press charges, but ended the relationship. He eventually became [[homeless]], and was found dead as a &quot;[[John Doe]]&quot; in the spring of 2007. She developed a deep compassion for the mentally ill afterward, but still feels guilty for not being able to help him. She states that she is a big supporter of the U.S [[military]]. She says that her father was an M60 Door Gunner on a Huey during the [[Vietnam War]]. His helicopter crashed three times and he received a [[Purple Heart]]. In her final year as the SVU ADA, she grew increasingly more reckless and unsure in her prosecution. It is implied that friend and former boss [[Elizabeth Donnelly|Liz Donnelly]] aided in her disbarment, leading to her replacement by Kim Greylek.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
