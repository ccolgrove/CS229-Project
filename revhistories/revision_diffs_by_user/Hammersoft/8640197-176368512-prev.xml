He meets Jill as one of the few surviving operatives from the Delta Platoon, along with Carlos and Mikhail. He is in fact one of the &quot;supervisors&quot;, U.B.C.S. operatives assigned to watch and gather combat data as their comrades fight against Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nicholai's ultimate fate varies depending on which route the player takes. He can be killed by the Nemesis, killed by the player, or escape successfully.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Lt. Mikhail Victor''' (voiced by Ben Campbell) is the leader of the U.B.C.S. Delta Platoon that both, [[#Nicholai Ginovaef|Nicholai]] and [[#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos]], are part of. According to his backstory, Mikhail is from [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. He originally served the [[Red Army]] before joining his wife's guerilla force and participating in race liberation wars in neighboring countries until he was eventually arrested by the Russian Army and convicted of acts of [[terrorism]]. He was then coerced into leading the U.B.C.S. in exchange for his men's freedom.&amp;lt;ref name=rearchives&amp;gt;''Resident Evil Archives'', 2005, Capcom&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In the game, he first appears already wounded inside the city's cable car. Despite his serious injuries, he refuses to rest, as evident in an optional cut scene in which he gets out of the cable car to fight a few zombies. Ultimately, he chose to sacrifice his own life to save Jill and Carlos. He dies in the game when he is blown apart by his own grenade in a failed attempt to destroy the Nemesis. In the novelization by S.D. Perry, Mikhail's injury was due to being shot by Nicholai.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Dario Rosso''' (voiced by [[Tony Rosato]]) is a Raccoon City citizen whom Jill encounters in a warehouse at the very beginning of the game. Having lost his daughter (Lucia) during the zombie outbreak, he locks himself in a container, refusing Jill's offer to aid him and stating that he would rather die from starvation then face the monsters. Later, in the game, when Jill returns she finds he has died in the container. Searching the container he originally hid in will yield his diary, in which he describes his aspirations to become a writer. This diary is featured in the Nintendo 64 version of ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' as an &quot;EX File&quot;. Both Dario and his daughter Lucia appears as hostages to be rescued in the &quot;Operation: Mad Jackal&quot; minigame. Dario's name (with his last name is misspelled Losso) also appears on the Apple Inn's guest list in ''Resident Evil: Outbreak''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
