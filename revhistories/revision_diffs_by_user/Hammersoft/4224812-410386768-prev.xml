  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2007, Disney Channel remodeled its looks. The logo, instead of bouncing around the screen, turned into a ribbon and swirled around the screen until forming the logo. 2007 saw the debut of two new original series, the That's So Raven spinoff Cory in the House which ended after two seasons (a possible casualty of the 2007 Writer's Guild strike, which caused freshman or sophomore series whose production was interrupted midway through the season to eventually be cancelled), and the popular Wizards of Waverly Place, starring Selena Gomez, David Henrie and Jake T. Austin. 2008 is recognized for its new series such as Phineas and Ferb, Brian O'Brian, and The Suite Life on Deck, the spin-off to The Suite Life of Zack &amp;amp; Cody, plus new Disney Channel Original Movies such as Camp Rock , Minutemen and The Cheetah Girls: One World. The Suite Life on Deck was the number one series in the respective categories in kids ages 6â12 and tweens ages 9â14 in 2008.[6]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2009, Disney Channel launched two new series: Sonny with a Chance (the first original series shot in high definition) starring Demi Lovato in February, and JONAS starring the Jonas Brothers in May. New movies in 2009 included: Dadnapped, Hatching Pete, Princess Protection Program, and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie. The four original movies for 2009 had the widest range of Disney Channel Stars in the networks history. First time ever since Starstruck the Disney Channel original movie premiered in May 2010 had been displayed in a widescreen aspect ratio (16:9).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A new set of programme mini-idents were launched on Saturday 11 September. The theme for each ident is made for the programme. The idents previously had a polkadot background. So far the UK has only seen the new logo in the new 2010 CHRISTMAS advert and a [[shake it up]] advert back in September, though this advert was only shown once and that was during the premiÃ¨re of Camp Rock 2, a [[shake it up]] advert was shown again until late October. The new international logo is going to premiere in &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;2011, Rumours say around a year after it did in USA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
