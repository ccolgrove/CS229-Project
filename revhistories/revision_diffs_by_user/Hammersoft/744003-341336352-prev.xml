The group, which was led by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], killed him on or about June 22 when South Korea refused to meet their demands that it cancel its plans to send 3,000 more troops to Iraq and withdraw the 660 military medics and engineers already there. (This would put South Korea behind only the [[United Kingdom]] in number of non-U.S. coalition troops in Iraq.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

However, on June 22, after initial reports that the militants had given their hostage more time, [[Al Jazeera]] television reported that they had received a videotape footage of Kim being [[decapitation|decapitated]] by five men, like hostages [[Nick Berg]] and [[Ken Bigley]] in Iraq, [[Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.|Paul Johnson]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Daniel Pearl]] in [[Pakistan]]. The report was subsequently confirmed by the South Korean government.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
