This fortress belonged to Sir [[Andrew de Moray]], who was fatally wounded at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] in 1297.  It passed by marriage to the [[House of Douglas]].  The lordship was bestowed in 1487 on [[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell|Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Lord Hailes, 1st Earl of Bothwell]].  When he resigned in 1491 the title passed to &quot;Bell-the-Cat&quot;, [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus]].  The title ultimately passed to the [[Earl of Home|Earls of Home]].  The castle is a fine example of [[Gothic architecture]].  It consists of a great [[quadrangle]] with circular towers on the south.  At the east end stand the remains of the chapel.  An unpretentious mansion was built nearby by [[Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar]] (1653&amp;amp;ndash;1712), and was known as New Bothwell Castle, but suffered mining subsidence and was demolished in 1926.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
