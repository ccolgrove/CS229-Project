  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joan of Arc is assisted by four French knights who lay siege on William's castle. William the Conqueror defends with four Norman soldiers. Two of the Norman soldiers fire their composite crossbows and both miss. The knights shoot their siege cannon, damaging the wall, and killing a soldier behind it. William orders his men to fire the torsion catapult, successfully killing one of the knights. The siege cannon launches another shot and destroys the catapult. A Norman soldier shoots his bow, but misses his target. The knight fires back with his steel crossbow and kills the soldier. A Norman shoots Joan with his crossbow but it doesn't penetrate her armor. Then he shoots a knight in the face and kills him. Then Joan shoots and kills a soldier. Then a soldier kills a knight with the broadsword. Then Joan kills him with her arming sword. Next, Joan and the knight go up the stairs to find William. William kills the knight with his broadsword and pushes him off the stairs. William and Joan fight with their swords. William hit her in the stomach but her armor protected her. Then Joan thrust her sword twice through Williams leg, and finished him off by thrusting the sword through his chest. He falls down dead, and Joan gives a battle cry. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
