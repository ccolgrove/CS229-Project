After the accident, Jason was angry when everyone who knew him tried to mold him into the person he used to be. He could not stand the way people looked at him as if they hoped to see some glint of recognition in his eyes. Jason hated General Hospital and he hated the Quartermaine Mansion even more. Ned Ashton convinced the Quartermaines to put one percent of ELQ stock into a trust fund for Jason so he would be able to live on his own. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jason finally left the Quartermaine Mansion, pushed his family, friends, and Keesha away, and changed his name to Jason Morgan in honor of his grandmother [[Lila Morgan Quartermaine]]. The birthday he would declare as his own was not the day he was born but the day of the accident. Jason remained close to his grandmother Lila and his sister Emily and was able to tolerate Ned because of Robinâs influence. Sonny and Jason became friends and Jason started to work for him as an errand boy. Sonnyâs wife [[Lily]] had a calming effect on Jason. Jason became Sonnyâs mob enforcer and  discovered that he was quite good at his job. He converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to be a Roman Catholic because Sonny was a practitioner of that faith even though Jason Quartermaine had been raised Episcopalian. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
