  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A blue-skinned monster who speaks with a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[accent]], Berk is the main character or [[protagonist]] of the show, and steward or caretaker of the monsters' castle. Berk is also the loyal and versatile servant of &quot;The Thing Upstairs&quot;, an [[unseen character]], although Berk's loyalty to his master may also have something to do with the fact he is terrified of &quot;The Thing Upstairs&quot;. Despite this Berk often goes to his duties and chores with simple-minded glee, and especially enjoys cooking up exotic things in his kitchen, usually with ingredients such as mud, eyeballs, snakes and worms. Berk is often warned not to open the trap door by his friends and he is strictly forbidden from doing so by his master, although in most episodes Berk does open the trap door, sometimes out of sheer child-like curiosity and other times to fetch something from the mysterious caverns below the castle (such as to fetch worms to feed his pet, Drutt.) Berk is often careless and irresponsible enough to leave the trap door open, allowing a less friendly monster to escape from the caverns below and wreak chaos in the castle. Berk is usually lighthearted, optimistic and cheery unless he is having a hard time dealing with a monster from the trap door. He also tends to shrug off Boni's (usually rather paranoid) warnings and often forces him to do things Boni would like to skip, such as taking him fishing in the [[swamp]] outside the castle. Berk's usual exclamation is &quot;globbits!&quot;, and also &quot;sniff that!&quot; He also enjoys &quot;bonking&quot; things (hitting other monsters over the head with blunt objects).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
