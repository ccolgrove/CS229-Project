He also occasionally appears to serve as a prosecutor. In one episode, he worked for Luvum &amp;amp; Burnham. Unlike [[Lionel Hutz]] or [[Gil Gunderson|Gil]], âBlue-Hairâ is a competent and accredited, though not necessarily ethical, lawyer. He has served as [[Montgomery Burns|Burnsâ]] head lawyer, and is known to be Mr. Burnsâ best and most cunning lawyer, helping him out with threats of the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|Power Plant]] closing down and of Burns losing his money. He is a member of the Springfield [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. His clients tend to be antagonists of the Simpsons but there have been exceptions, such as Bart hiring him to get himself emancipated. He apparently gets frustrated with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] occasionally. Writers [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] have both stated on the DVD commentaries that the voice is based on [[McCarthyism|McCarthy-era]] lawyer [[Roy Cohn]], and animator [[Jim Reardon]] has said that he is designed to look like character actor [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

After informing Mr. Burns of the need for a real emergency exit as opposed to the one painted on the wall, he got sucked into a tube that took him to a room where he was forced to dance for cackling men in turbans. In his absence, [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Mindy Simmons|Mindy Simmons]] briefly took his place, but got fired afterwards. His first appearance was in &quot;[[Life on the Fast Lane]]&quot;, when after Homer leaves the table during lunch he says, &quot;Domestic problem&quot;. He is occasionally seen in [[Moe's Tavern]] drinking. In &quot;[[King-Size Homer]]&quot; he was briefly disabled as stated by Lenny after Homer notices he is not at the plant. However, he is well and healthy at the end of the episode. He has a wife and two children, seen in [[Homer the Smithers]]. He has an office, as seen in a CCTV camera in [[Homer Goes To College]]. He tells Homer (while Homer is working for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]) that he has a plan to [[revolution|overthrow the government]] because they are not making [[high-definition television|HDTV]] happen soon enough, and is promptly arrested for conspiracy.
