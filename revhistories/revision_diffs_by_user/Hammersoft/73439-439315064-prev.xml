  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to director [[Chuck Jones]], this film demonstrated for the first time that animation can create ''characters'' with a recognizable personality, independent of their appearance, [[Social environment|milieu]], or voice. Although in the end, the animator is revealed to be Daffy's rival [[Bugs Bunny]] (who famously declares &quot;Ain't I a stinker?&quot;), according to Jones the ending is just for comedic value: Jones (the director) is speaking to the audience directly, asking &quot;Who is Daffy Duck anyway? Would you recognize him if I did ''this'' to him?  What if he didn't live in the woods? Didn't live anywhere? What if he had no voice? No face? What if he wasn't even a duck anymore?&quot; In all cases, it is obvious that Daffy is still Daffy; not all cartoon characters can claim such distinctive personality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
