  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Throughout the series and the movie, three rude, foul-mouthed, crotchety old men make frequent appearances, as speaking characters, or in the background during scenes. They make various claims about what they did before becoming old-timers, including bounty hunting, building the stargates, farming, piloting planes in a war, sinking the [[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]], digging ditches, and crop-dusting, all of which claims are almost always followed with the rest claiming they were part of that project as well. They seem on speaking terms with many supporting characters, and though they run into the main characters often there is not much attention paid to them (or even mention that the main characters have seen them before). They also did the voice-overs for the preview of the episode &quot;[[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 17.2C Mushroom Samba|Mushroom Samba]]&quot;. According to the movie credits, they are called {{nihongo|Antonio|ã¢ã³ãããª|Antonio}}, {{nihongo|Carlos|ã«ã«ã­ã¹|Karurosu}}, and {{nihongo|Jobim|ã¸ã§ãã³|Jobin}}. In the feature film, they help Jet and Faye distribute the antidote for a deadly, hallucinogenic nanovirus by flying 20th-century era antique planes over Alba City. The three old men are actually bounty hunters themselves, as revealed in the Cowboy Bebop Silver Anniversary disc. ''Cowboy Bebop Anime Guide Volume 4'' states that since the names of the three old men appear once, it is not certain whether the names Antonio, Carlos, and Jobim are their real names.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;AnimeGuideVol467&quot;/&amp;gt; In episode 22, Cowboy Funk, Antonio is briefly seen walking past a water fountain without Carlos and Jobim, although previously all three old men were always seen together. The movie, which takes place between episodes 22 and 23, depicts the three old men together, but in episode 23, Brain Scratch, Antonio is seen dead with several other bounty hunters, again without Carlos and Jobim.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
