  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;His 3,154 career hits are the most by any third baseman in major league history, and 15th all-time. Baseball historian [[Bill James]] regards him as the second-best third baseman of all time, trailing only his contemporary, [[Mike Schmidt]]. Brett was elected to the Hall of Fame in [[1999 in baseball|1999]], with what was then the fourth-highest voting percentage in baseball history (98.2%), trailing only [[Tom Seaver]], [[Nolan Ryan]], and [[Ty Cobb]]. In 2007, [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] passed Brett with 98.5% of the vote. His voting percentage was higher than all-time outfielders [[Babe Ruth]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Stan Musial]], [[Ted Williams]], and [[Joe DiMaggio]]. That same year, he ranked Number 55 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the [[Sporting news 100 greatest baseball players|100 Greatest Baseball Players]], and was nominated as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team. Brett is one of four players in MLB history to accumulate 3,000 hits, 300 home runs, and a career .300 batting average (the others are [[Stan Musial]], [[Willie Mays]], and [[Hank Aaron]]). Most indicative of his hitting style, Brett is sixth on the career doubles list, with 665 (trailing [[Tris Speaker]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Stan Musial]], [[Ty Cobb]], and [[Craig Biggio]]). Combining his superior hitting skill with his great defensive ability and team focus (and humility), George Brett is arguably one of the most complete baseball players of all time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brett is probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest tobacco chewing baseball player of the modern era. Brett holds the current major league record for cans of Skoal used during a regular season (448 in 1980), all-time (2,389) and career average per game: (2.346 CPG, edging out [[Lenny Dykstra]]). Brett also holds the MLB record for most tobacco chewed without losing time to major cancer surgery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
