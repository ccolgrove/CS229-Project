  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Myrmecophily (literally âant-loveâ) is the term applied to positive interspecific associations between ants and a variety of other organisms such as plants, arthropods, and fungi. There are an estimated 10,000 species of ants (Formicadae), with global diversity concentrated in the tropics &amp;lt;ref name=one&amp;gt; B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, The Ants,  Cambridge, Massachussetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1990.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. In most terrestrial ecosystems ants are ecologically and numerically dominant and are the leading invertebrate predators. As a result, ants play a key role in controlling arthropod richness, abundance, and community structure &amp;lt;ref name=two&amp;gt;K. Fiedler, B. Holldobler, and P.

Most myrmecophilous associations are opportunistic, unspecialized, and facultative (meaning both species are capable of surviving without the interaction), though obligate mutualisms (those in which one or both species are dependant on the interaction for survival) have also been observed for many species &amp;lt;ref name=five&amp;gt;B.

In general, myrmecophytes (or ant plants) usually provide some form of shelter and food in exchange for ant âtending,â which may include protection, seed dispersal, reduced competition from other plants, hygienic services, and/or nutrient supplementation &amp;lt;ref name=one/&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;ref name=seven&amp;gt; M. Heil and D. McKey, âProtective ant-plant interactions as model systems in ecological and evolutionary research,â Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics,  vol. 34, 2003, pp. 425-453./&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Three of the most common and important structural adaptations of ant plants are the domatia, Beltian bodies and extrafloral nectaries. Plant domatia are pre-formed nesting sites provided by the plant in the form of hollowed out stems, petioles, thorns, or curled leaves &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. The production of ant-specialized domatia has been documented in over 100 genera of tropical plants. Beltian bodies provide a high-energy food source to ants in the form of nutritive corpuscles produced on leaflet tips &amp;lt;ref name=one/&amp;gt;, and they have been described in at least 20 plant families &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. Extrafloral nectaries (EFNâs) are known to occur in at least 66 families of angiosperm plants in both temperate and tropical regions, as well as some ferns, but are absent in all gymnosperms and are most abundant in the topics &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. As the name suggests, EFNâs occur outside of the plant flowers and are therefore not employed in pollination; their primary purpose is to attract and sustain tending ants. Many plants can control the flow of nectar from the EFNâs so that the availability of nectar varies according to daily and seasonal cycles. Because ants can respond quickly to changes in flow rate from EFNâs, this may be possible mechanism by which plants can induce greater ant activity during times of peak herbivory and minimize overall costs of nectar production &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. The combined nutritional output of EFNâs and Beltian bodies is a significant food source for tending ants, and in some cases can provide the total nutritive needs for an ant colony.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In exchange for nesting sites and food resources, ants protect plants from herbivores. Perhaps the best-known example of ant-plant mutualism is in bullhorn acacias (Acacia cornigera) and their tending Pseudomyrmex ants in African savannas &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;ref name=six/&amp;gt;. This system was studied extensively by Dan Janzen in the late 1960âs, who provided some of the first experimental evidence that ants significantly reduce herbivory rates of myrmecophytes &amp;lt;ref name=eight&amp;gt;D. Janzen, âCoevolution of mutualism between ants and acacias in Central America,â Evolution,  vol. 20, 1966, pp. 249-275.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;, and since then may other studies have demonstrated similar results in other systems as well &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;ref name=nine&amp;gt;D. Janzen, âInteraction of the bull's-horn acacia (Acacia cornigera L. ) with an ant inhabitant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea F. Smith) in Eastern Mexico,â Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull. ,  vol. 47, 1967, pp. 315-558.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. In exchange for protection, the acacias provide domatia, Beltian bodies, and EFNâs, and there is evidence that the Pseudomyrmex ants can survive exclusively on these food resources without having to engage in external foraging &amp;lt;ref name=one/&amp;gt;. For many plants, including the bullhorn acacias, ants can significantly reduce herbivory from both phytophagous insects as well as larger organisms, such as large grazing mammals. Obligately associated ant species are some of most aggressive ants in the world, and can defend a plant against herbivory by large mammals by repeatedly biting their attacker and spraying formic acid into the wound &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Myrmecophily is considered a form of indirect plant defense against herbivory, though ants often provide other services in addition to protection. Some ants provide hygienic services to keep leaf surfaces clean and deter disease, and defense against fungal pathogens has also been demonstrated &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. It is common for ants to prune epiphytes, vines, and parasitic plants from their host plant, and they sometimes thin the shoots of neighboring plants as well. In doing so, ants reduce plant-plant competition for space, light, nutrients, and water &amp;lt;ref name=one/&amp;gt;. Finally, current work  focusing on antsâ role in nutrient supplementation for plants has shown that in many ant-plant relationships nutrient flow is bidirectional. One study has estimated that while 80% of the carbon in the bodies of Azteca spp workers is supplied by the host tree (Cecropia spp.),  90% of the Cecropia treeâs nitrogen was supplied by ant debris carried to the tree as a result of external foraging &amp;lt;ref name=ten&amp;gt;G.

In light of these services, myrmecophily can be very advantageous in ensuring a plantâs survival and ecological success &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ants tend a wide variety of insect species, most notably lycaenid butterflies and homopterans &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. Forty-one percent of all ant genera include species that associate with insects &amp;lt;ref name=eleven&amp;gt;T.H. Oliver, S.R. Leather, and J.M.

In all ant-insect associations the ants provide some service in exchange for nutrients in the form of honeydew,  a sugary fluid excreted by many phytophagous insects &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. Interactions between honeydew-producing insects and ants is often called trophobiosis, a term which merges notions of trophic relationships with symbioses between ants and insects. This term has been criticized, however, on the basis that myrmecophilous interactions are often more complex than simple trophic interactions, and the use of symbiosis is inappropriate for describing interactions among free-living organisms &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some of the most well-studied myrmecophilous interactions involve ants and homopterans, especially aphids. There are ~4000 described species of aphids, and they are the most abundant myrmecophilous organisms in the northern temperate zones &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. Aphids feed on the phloem sap of plants, and as they feed they excrete honeydew droplets from their anus. The tending ants ingest these honeydew droplets then return to their nest to regurgitate the fluid for their nestmates &amp;lt;ref name=one/&amp;gt;. Between 90-95% of the dry weight of aphid honeydew is comprised of various sugars, while the remaining matter includes vitamins, minerals, and amino acids &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;. Aphid honeydew can provide an abundant food source for ants (aphids in the genus Tuerolachnus can secrete more honeydew droplets per hour than their body weight) and for some ants aphids may be their only source of food. In these circumstances, ants may supplement their honeydew intake by preying on the aphids once the aphid populations have reached certain densities. In this way ants can gain extra protein and ensure efficient resource extraction by maintaining honeydew flow rates that do not exceed the antsâ collection capabilities &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;. Even with some predation by ants, aphid colonies can reach larger densities with tending ants than colonies than without. Ants have been observed to tend large âherdsâ of aphids, protecting them from predators and parasitoids. Aphid species that are associated with ants often have reduced structural and behavioral defense mechanisms, and are less able to defend themselves from attack than aphid species that are not associated with ants &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ants engage in associations with other honeydew-producing homopterans such as scale insects (Coccidae), mealybugs (Pseudococciaes), and treehoppers (Membracidae), and most of these interaction are facultative and opportunistic with some cases of obligate associations, such as homopterans that are inquiline, meaning they can only survive inside ant nests &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. In addition to protection, ants may provide other services in exchange for homopteran honeydew. Some ants bring homopteran larvae into the ant nests and rear them along with their own ant brood &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;. Additionally, ants may actively aid in homopteran dispersal: queen ants have been observed transporting aphids during their dispersive flights to establish a new colony, and worker ants will often carry aphids to a new nesting site if the previous ant nest has been disturbed. Ants may also carry homopterans to different parts of a plant or to different plants in order to ensure a fresh food source and/or adequate protection for the herd.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Myrmecophily among lycaenid caterpillars differs from the associations of homopterans because caterpillars feed on plant tissues, not phloem sap, and therefore do not continually excrete honeydew. Caterpillars of lycaenid butterflies have therefore evolved specialized organs that secrete chemicals to feed and appease ants &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;. Because caterpillars do not automatically pass honeydew, they must be stimulated to secrete droplets and do so in response to ant antennation, which is the drumming or stroking of the caterpillarâs body by the antsâ antennae &amp;lt;ref name=two/&amp;gt;. Some caterpillars possess specialized receptors that allow them to distinguish between ant antennation and contact from predators and parasites, and others produce acoustic signals that agitate ants, making them more active and likely better defenders of the larvae &amp;lt;ref name=twelve&amp;gt;A.A. Agrawal and J.A.

Fiedler, Systematic, evolutionary, and ecological implication of myrmecophily withing the Lycaenidae,  UND Museum Alexander Koenig: Bonner Zoologische Monographien, 1991.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. As with homopteran myrmecophiles, ants protect Lycaenid larvae from predatory insects (including other ants) and parasitoid wasps, which lay their eggs in the bodies of many species of Lepidoptera larvae. The enemy-free space that ants can provide for lycaenids is significant: one study conducted by Pierce and colleagues in Colorado experimentally demonstrated that survival rates of G. lygdymus larvae declined 85-90% when ant partners were excluded &amp;lt;ref name=fourteen&amp;gt;A.M.

These interactions do not come without an energetic cost to the butterfly, however, and it has been shown that ant-tended individuals reach smaller adult sizes than non-tended individuals due to the costs of appeasing ants during the larval stage &amp;lt;ref name=fifteen&amp;gt;N.E. Pierce, M.F. Braby, A. Heath, D.J. Lohman, J. Mathew, D.B.

Interactions with ants are not limited to the butterflyâs larval stage, and in fact ants can be important partners for butterflies at all stages of their life cycle &amp;lt;ref name=two/&amp;gt;. For example, adult females of many lyceanid butterflies preferentially oviposit on plants where ant partners are present, possibly by using antsâ own chemical cues in order to locate sites where juvenile butterflies will likely be tended by ants &amp;lt;ref name=thirteen/&amp;gt;. Finally, while ant attendance has been most widely documented in Lycaenid butterflies (and to some extent riodinid butterflies), many other lepidopteran species are known to associate with ants, including many moths &amp;lt;ref name=thirteen/&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many trophobiotic ants can simultaneously maintain associations with multiple species &amp;lt;ref name=eleven/&amp;gt;. Ants that interact with myrmecophilous insects and myrmecophytes are highly associated: species that are adapted to interact with one of these myrmecophiles may switch among them depending on resource availability and quality. Of the ant genera that include species that associate with ant plants, 94% also include species that associate with trophobionts. In contrast, ants that are adapted to cultivate fungus (leaf cutter ants, tribe Attini) do not possess the morphological or behavioral adaptations to switch to trophobiotic partners &amp;lt;ref name=eleven/&amp;gt;. Many ant mutualists can exploit these multi-species interactions to maximize the benefits of myrmecophily. For example, some plants will host aphids instead of investing in EFNâs, which may be more energetically costly depending on local food availability &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;.

Combined with the fact that ants are one of the most dominant lifeforms on earth &amp;lt;ref name=six/&amp;gt;, it is clear that myrmecophily plays a significant role in the evolution and ecology of diverse organisms, and in the community structure of many terrestrial ecosystems. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Questions of how and why species coevolve are of great interest and significance. In many myrmecophilous organisms it is clear that ant associations have been influential in the ecological success, diversity, and persistence of species. Analyses of phylogenetic information for myrmecophilous organisms as well as ant lineages have demonstrated that myrmecophily has arisen independently in most groups multiple times. Because there have been multiple gains (and perhaps losses) of myrmecophilous adaptations, the evolutionary sequence of events in most lineages is unknown &amp;lt;ref name=fifteen/&amp;gt;.  Exactly how these associations evolve also remains unclear. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In studying the coevolution of myrmecophilous organisms, many researchers have addressed the relative costs and benefits of mutualistic interactions, which can vary drastically according to local species composition and abundance, variation in nutrient requirements and availability, host plant quality, presence of alternative food sources, abundance and composition of predator and parasitoid species, and abiotic conditions &amp;lt;ref name=eleven/&amp;gt;. Because of the large amounts of variation in some of these factors, the mechanisms that support the stable persistence of myrmecophily are still unknown &amp;lt;ref name=sixteen/&amp;gt;. In many cases, variation in external factors can result in interactions that shift along a continuum of mutualism, commensalism, and even parasitism. In almost all mutualisms, the relative costs and benefits of interactions are asymmetrical; that is, one partner experiences more benefits and/or fewer costs than the other partner. This asymmetry leads to âcheating,â in which one partner evolves strategies to receive benefits without providing services in return. As with many other mutualisms, cheating has evolved in interactions between ants and their partners. For example, some lycaenid larvae are taken into ant nests where they predate on ant brood and offer no services to the ants &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;. Other lycaenids may parasitize ant-plant relationships by feeding on plants that are tended by ants, apparently immune to ant attack because of their own appeasing secretions . Homopterphagous lycaenids engage in a similar form of parasitism in  ant-homopteran associations &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. In light of the variability in outcomes of mutualistic interactions, and also the evolution of cheating in many systems, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms that maintain mutualism as an evolutionarily stable interaction &amp;lt;ref name=seventeen/&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In addition to leading to coevolution, mutualisms also play an important role in structuring communities &amp;lt;ref name=sixteen/&amp;gt;. One of the most obvious ways in which myrmecophily influences community structure is by allowing for the coexistence of species which might otherwise be antagonists or competitors. For many myrmecophiles, engaging in ant associations is first and foremost a method of avoiding predation by ants. For example, the caterpillars of lycaenid butterflies are an ideal source of food for ants: they are slow-moving, soft-bodied, and highly nutritious, yet they have evolved complex structures to not only appease ant aggression but to elicit protective services from the ants &amp;lt;ref name=two/&amp;gt;.  In order to explain why ants cooperate with other species as opposed to predating on them, two related hypotheses have been proposed: cooperation either provides ants with resources that are otherwise difficult to find, or it ensures the long-term availability of those resources &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At both small and large spatiotemporal scales, mutualistic interactions influence patterns of species richness, distribution, and abundance &amp;lt;ref name=eighteen&amp;gt;J.J. Stachowicz, âMutualism, Facilitation, and the Structure of Ecological Communities,â BioScience,  vol. 51, Mar. 2001, pp. 235-246.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. Myrmecophilous interactions play an important role in determining community structure by influencing inter- and intraspecific competition; regulating population densities of arthropods, fungi, and plants; determining arthropod species assemblages; and influencing trophic dynamics &amp;lt;ref name=five/&amp;gt;. Recent work in tropical forests has shown that ant mutualisms may play key roles in structuring food webs, as ants can control entire communities of arthropods in forest canopies &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. Myrmecophily has also been key in the ecological success of ants. Ant biomass and abundance in many ecosystems exceeds that of their potential prey, suggesting a strong role of myrmecophily in supporting larger populations of ants than would otherwise be possible &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;. Furthermore, by providing associational refugia and habitat amelioration for many species, ants are considered dominant ecosystem engineers &amp;lt;ref name=three/&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;ref name=eighteen/&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Because many myrmecophilous relationships are easily manipulable and tractable, they allow for testing and experimentation that may not be possible in other interactions. Therefore they provide ideal model systems in which to explore the magnitude, dynamics, and frequency of mutualism in nature &amp;lt;ref name=seven/&amp;gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
