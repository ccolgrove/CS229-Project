Quinn is occasionally hinted at as having high intelligence but simply disguising it. The final two seasons show a growth of her character, depicting the beginnings of her personal maturation and reconciliation with her sister (in the Season 5 episode &quot;Lucky Strike&quot;, Quinn tells her entire class that Daria is her sister). Quinn is voiced by [[Wendy Hoopes]].  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

A laid-back slacker, meant to be the stereotypical [[Generation X]] slacker of the 1990s, he's not sure of whether or not he graduated high school, and he drives &quot;Trentmobile&quot;, a broken-down 1973 [[Plymouth Satellite]] coupe. He sings and plays lead guitar in garage band [[Mystik Spiral]] (though they're thinking of changing the name) and bears a strong resemblance to [[Jakob Dylan]] of [[The Wallflowers]] (though it is strongly speculated that he is actually based on [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]). He was also Daria's romantic interest for the first three seasons of the series, and, although he was aware of her feelings, it was never made clear whether he reciprocated them to any degree. They had a sort of non-break up break-up in the Season 3 finale &quot;Jane's Addition&quot;, when they discuss a class project where Trent failed to assist Daria and Jane, and it became an implicit acknowledgment that it wouldn't work out if they ever dated. Compared with sister Jane, he seems to have had a harder time adjusting to the lack of parental support in his life. Trent's perpetual laziness is presented in almost every aspect of his personality, down to his voice, which is provided by theatre actor [[Alvaro J. Gonzalez]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

A laid-back slacker, meant to be the stereotypical [[Generation X]] slacker of the 1990s, he's not sure of whether or not he graduated high school, and he drives &quot;Trentmobile&quot;, a broken-down 1973 [[Plymouth Satellite]] coupe. He sings and plays lead guitar in garage band [[Mystik Spiral]] (though they're thinking of changing the name) and bears a strong resemblance to [[Jakob Dylan]] of [[The Wallflowers]] (though it is strongly speculated that he is actually based on [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]). He was also Daria's romantic interest for the first three seasons of the series, and, although he was aware of her feelings, it was never made clear whether he reciprocated them to any degree. They had a sort of non-break up break-up in the Season 3 finale &quot;Jane's Addition&quot;, when they discuss a class project where Trent failed to assist Daria and Jane, and it became an implicit acknowledgment that it wouldn't work out if they ever dated. Compared with sister Jane, he seems to have had a harder time adjusting to the lack of parental support in his life. Trent's perpetual laziness is presented in almost every aspect of his personality, down to his voice, which is provided by theatre actor [[Alvaro J. Gonzalez]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
