Players match notes that scroll on-screen to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;african american &lt;/span&gt;[[fret]] buttons on the controller, [[strum]]ming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited.  The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast-fingering [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s and the use of the [[whammy bar]] to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, the game includes support for a four-player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly [[cover version]] of songs created by [[WaveGroup Sound]], but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully [[master recording]]s, and in some cases, special re-recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for [[downloadable content]] in the form of new songs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2005, RedOctane, a company primarily in the manufacture of unique game controllers, was inspired to create ''Guitar Hero'' based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for [[Konami]]'s ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'' [[arcade game]]. They enlisted [[Harmonix Music Systems]], who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of [[USD|$]]1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by [[Activision]] in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by [[MTV Games]] and went on to create the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of music games in the same vein as ''Guitar Hero''. Activision brought [[Neversoft]] (primarily known for their [[Tony Hawk (series)|''Tony Hawk'' series of skateboarding games]]) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as [[Vicarious Visions]], [[Budcat Creations]], Machineworks Northwest, and [[Aspyr Media]] have assisted in the adoption of the games for other systems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
