While atypically telegenic and uncommonly articulate, he had his share of detractors and was not known to be immune to ambitions and excesses of the ruling political class. However, during his seven years and seven months imprisoned as a political prisoner of Marcos, Aquino read the book ''Born Again'' by convicted [[Watergate]] conspirator [[Charles Colson]] and it inspired him to a religious awakening.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ripZFVtUQ]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
