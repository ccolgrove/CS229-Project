  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Superintendent Gary Chalmers''', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield's]] school district. He first appeared in the episode &quot;[[Whacking Day]]&quot;. Chalmers is a strict and largely humorless man, with a short temper and low tolerance for disorder or rule-breaking; his general manner and personality like that of a military officer. Whenever he visits Springfield Elementary, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening. Chalmers is known for throwing open the doors to the room and bellowing &quot;SKIN-NER!!!&quot; or &quot;SEY-MOUR!!!&quot;, to which Seymour stammers &quot;S-Superintendent Chalmers!&quot;. His catchphrase has caused some [[paranoia]] in Skinner (as seen in &quot;[[Lisa's Date with Density]]&quot;). On a few occasions he says Skinner's name this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner's name this way by habit, or does it on purpose to scare him. On one occasion, he screamed it and when he got no answer, he said it again in a caring matter. Skinner then replied &quot;I'm here sir&quot; to which he said &quot;Don't ever scare me like that again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She has served many distasteful things to the students, including whole beef [[heart]]s, horse [[testicle]]s, and ground-up gym mats. She has been implied to have a relationship with [[Groundskeeper Willie]], and her son is the [[Squeaky Voiced Teen]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

He first appeared in &quot;[[Bart the Genius]]&quot;, and it was his decision to send [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to the school for [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] children. He is also the one Bart goes to when he wants to go back to his regular school. In &quot;[[Bart Gets An F]]&quot;, he tells Bart that he may have to repeat the 4th Grade. His voice saying this echoes around Bart's head. He then appears again, discussing Bart's problems at school and Lisa's special gift in a flashback sequence of &quot;[[Lisa's Sax]]&quot;. In this episode he also (mistakenly) revealed that [[Milhouse van Houten]] possesses &quot;flamboyantly homosexual&quot; tendencies. Pryor does not appear again until &quot;[[See Homer Run]]&quot;, when he tells Lisa that she is going through a developmental condition. He then makes many other appearances.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
