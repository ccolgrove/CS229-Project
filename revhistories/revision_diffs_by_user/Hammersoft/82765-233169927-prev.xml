  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Smith has had an extensive career both on screen and in live theatre, and is known as one of Britain's pre-eminent actresses. She began her career at the [[Oxford Playhouse]] with [[Frank Shelley]] and made her first film in 1956. She became a fixture at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in the 1960s, most notably for playing [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]'' opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] and winning her first [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for her performance in the [[Othello (1965 film)|1965 film version]]. In 1969 she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance as an unorthodox Scottish schoolteacher in ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'', a role originally created on stage by [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in 1966. She was also awarded the 1978 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as the brittle actress Diana Barrie in ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]],'' acting opposite [[Michael Caine]]. Afterwards, on hearing that [[Michael Palin]] was about to embark on a film (''[[The Missionary]]'') with Smith, Caine is supposed to have humorously telephoned Palin, warning him that she would steal the film.  She also starred with Palin in the dark but hilarious film [[A Private Function]] in 1984. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Image:Minerva McGonagall.jpg|thumb|150px|Maggie Smith is [[Minerva McGonagall]]]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Indeed, many of her more mature roles have centred on what Smith refers to as her &quot;gallery of grotesques&quot;, playing waspish, sarcastic or plain rude characters. Recent examples of this would include the judgemental sister in ''[[Ladies in Lavender]]'' and the cantankerous snob Constance Trentham in ''[[Gosford Park]],'' for which she received another [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
