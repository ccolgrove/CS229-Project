  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Johnston Hall is one of the only residences at the University of Guelph with cameras in all hallways. These cameras are 360-degree cameras without volume. They are installed into the ceiling panels, usually 2-3 cameras per straight hallway. The cameras are not monitored on a 24-hour basis, but used as a precautionary measure in case an incident does occur. Having said that, Johnston Hall is locked on a 24-hour basis, and residents need to use their key to enter the building, and another key to enter their residence room and mailbox. In terms of accessibility, Johnston Hall is a handicap friendly building, which is serviced by one elevator that can only be used by occupants with a designated key. Otherwise, most students use the wide stair cases located in nearly every hallway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
