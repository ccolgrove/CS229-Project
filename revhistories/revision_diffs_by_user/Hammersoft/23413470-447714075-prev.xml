  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lizzie is first seen in April 2009, when she meets [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) at community service. Laurel takes pity on Lizzie after realising she is blind, and buys her a meal after Lizzie lies and says she has left her purse on the bus. Lizzie is then reunited with her old friend [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]) in the village shop and whilst in the shop she tries to steal some items and puts them into her bag. However, Lisa catches her and asks her to put them back, with Lizzie getting out her purse which she had told Laurel she had lost. When leaving Laurel and [[Ashley Thomas|Ashley's]] ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]) Lizzie is taken away by the police after not obeying her curfew. Lizzie moves in with the Dingles but outstays her welcome which annoys [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) and she soon makes friends in the village. Lizzie makes friends with [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]) and begins to support him in the upcoming council election, but when she is bribed with money she supports [[Eric Pollard]] ([[Chris Chittell]]) instead. She attends a council function for the disabled with him, but they are both removed by security when she is recognised as a thief and her tag is seen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Eli doesn't trust Lizzie and begins to follow her to find out where she makes her money. It eventually turns out that she is working on a [[psychic]] hotline and Marlon later discovers that she is, in fact, the psychic that he had been ringing and asking for romantic advice. After he makes Lizzie give back the money he spent on the premium phone calls. When she wins some money on a scratch card, Eli Dingle and Jake Doland trick her in order to keep the winnings themselves. However, Jake feels guilty and owns up, returning the money. In his defence, Eli then observes that Lizzie herself is a con-artist and she starts to question her own behaviour. She and Eli gradually become good friends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Lizzie is attacked by an angry [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) sending her handbag into the river and causing her to fall to the ground; thinking she has been mugged, Lizzie calls the police. Aaron later returns the bag after fishing it out of the river which Lizzie is grateful for, however he does not accept the reward she offered him. Lizzie is left feeling traumatised by this â vulnerable at her lack of eyesight. Marlon and Eli become very concerned when she refuses to leave the house. Lisa eventually speaks to her and Lizzie confesses that she had once been violently mugged and just how much her blindness scares her under all the bravado. Lizzie is intimidated when a desperate [[Shadrach Dingle]] ([[Andy Devine (English actor)|Andy Devine]]) hassles her for money for alcohol when they are alone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
