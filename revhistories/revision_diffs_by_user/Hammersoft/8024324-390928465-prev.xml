  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;When Leigh Whannell asked Elwes what he thought about his character's fate on the commentary for the ''Saw: Uncut Edition'' DVD, Elwes responded with, &quot;Let's face it, guys. He's severed his whole leg off. The loss of blood alone, even with that pathetic tourniquet he made with his shirt. It's a wrap. He's not going to get two blocks.&quot; [[Darren Lynn Bousman]] said on the DVD commentaries for ''Saw IV'' that his intent was to leave Dr. Gordon's fate an unanswered question and let fans make up their own minds. In a November 2009 podcast interview with Matt Horn of [[Demon FM]], he asked Patrick Melton, co-writer of ''IV'', ''V'', ''VI'' and the upcoming ''[[Saw 3D]]'', if Dr. Gordon's fate would be answered before the series ended. Melton stated that Gordon's fate would be revealed in the seventh installment of the series.&amp;lt;ref name= &quot;Patrick Melton - Interview by Matt Horn / David Murphy&quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.demonfm.co.uk/?q=node/596/ DemonFM.co.uk].
