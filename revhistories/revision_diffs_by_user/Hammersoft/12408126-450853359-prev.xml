  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Davis was given an opportunity to present new evidence at a hearing in federal court in Savannah in June 2010, but he put on only a paucity of testimony. He did not take the stand in his defense and did not call Sylvester Coles as a witness. He also did not call some of the other witnesses who had given affidavits on his behalf, even though some of them were present in the courthouse. Savannah journalist Patrick Rodgers characterized the hearing as a defeat for Davis, commenting, &quot;Although the defense team had been arguing for a hearing like this since they took over the case, if the atmosphere after last Thursday was any &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;indication, &lt;/span&gt;they seemed to be wishing they could have a second chance.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Patrick Rodgers, &quot;Sound and Fury: The Troy Davis Hearing,&quot; ConnectSavannah.com, June 29, 2010, http://www.connectsavannah.com/news/article/102444/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
