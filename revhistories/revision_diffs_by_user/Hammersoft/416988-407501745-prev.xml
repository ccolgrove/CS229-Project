  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;When they catch up with the Cube, the Borg demand the ''Enterprise'' turn over [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]].  The Borg lock the ''Enterprise'' in a tractor beam and attempt to cut open the ship upon Picard's refusal.  Shelby suggests a means of randomly changing the frequency of the ship's phasers to bypass the Borg defenses, allowing them to destroy the tractor beam and escape to a nearby nebula to effect repairs and determine a strategy.  Using Shelby's previous tactic, they work at modifying the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s deflector dish in the same manner as the phasers, which will be destructive to the Cube should they weaken its defenses.  Before repairs are completed, the Borg flush the ''Enterprise'' from the nebula with magnetometric-guided charges, and then board the ship in its weakened state, abducting Picard.  The Borg Cube moves off at high [[warp drive (Star Trek)|warp speed]] towards Earth, with the ''Enterprise'' giving chase.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Aboard the Cube, the Borg are unresponsive to their presence, allowing them to locate Picard's discarded clothes.  With the ''Enterprise'' nearly at the point where they will no longer be able to keep up with the Cube, the away team destroys power nodes inside the Cube, forcing it out of warp but also alerting the Borg drones to their presence.  As they prepare to transport out of the ship, they spot Picard, now assimilated as a Borg drone.  Once aboard the ''Enterprise'', the Borg contact the ship, with Picard speaking for the Borg.  He tells the ''Enterprise'' that he is now &quot;Locutus of Borg&quot;, and to prepare for assimilation.  Riker, after confirming the deflector dish is ready, gives the order to fire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
