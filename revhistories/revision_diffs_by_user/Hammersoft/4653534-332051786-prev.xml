  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The island of Iwo Jima and the critical [[airstrip]]s there served as the next area of battle.  The Japanese had learned from their defeat at the [[Battle of Saipan]] and prepared many fortified positions on the island, including [[Bunker|pillboxes]] and underground tunnels.  The American attack began on 19 February 1945.  Initially the Japanese put up little resistance, letting the Americans mass, creating more targets before the Americans took intense fire from [[Mount Suribachi]] and fought throughout the night until the hill was surrounded.  Even as the Japanese were pressed into an ever shrinking pocket, they chose to fight to the end, leaving only 1,000 of the original 21,000 alive.  The Allies suffered as well, losing 7,000 men, but they were victorious again, however, and reached the summit of Mount Suribachi on 23 February.  It was there that five Marines and one Navy Corpsman famously [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|planted the American flag]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
