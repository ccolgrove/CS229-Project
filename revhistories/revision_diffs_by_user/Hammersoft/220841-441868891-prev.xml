  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the United States, in states where Mexican Americans make up a large percentage of the population, such as [[California]] and [[Texas]], &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;undocumented &lt;/span&gt;as well as legal immigrants from Mexico and Central America in addition to Mexican Americans combined often make up a large majority of workers in many [[blue-collar]] occupations: the majority of the employed men are restaurant workers, janitors, truck drivers, gardeners, construction laborers, material moving workers, or perform other types of manual or other blue collar labor (Source, U.S. Census Bureau, American community survey data.). Many women also work in low wage service and retail occupations. In many of these places with large [[Latino]] populations, many types of blue-collar workers are often assumed to be Mexican American or Mexican or other Latino immigrants (Although a large minority are actually not. -Source, U.S. Census Bureau, American community survey data.) because of their frequent dominance in those occupations and stereotyping. Occasionally, tensions have risen between Mexican immigrants and other ethnic groups because of increasing concerns over the availability of working-class jobs to Americans and immigrants from other ethnic groups. However, tensions have also risen among Hispanic American laborers who have been displaced because of both cheap Mexican labor and ethnic profiling. African American workers in lower-wage jobs have been displaced by undocumented Mexican laborers and their neighborhoods have been transformed from majority black to majority Latino, which has caused some racial tensions between African Americans and Mexicans in the Southwest US. Even legal immigrants to the United States, both from Mexico and elsewhere, have spoken out against illegal immigration. However, according to a survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] in June 2007, 63% of Americans would support an immigration policy that would put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship if they &quot;pass background checks, pay fines and have jobs, learn English&quot;, while 30% would oppose such a plan. The survey also found that if this program was instead labeled &quot;amnesty&quot;, 54% would support it, while 39% would oppose.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=335 Summary of Findings: Mixed Views on Immigration Bill]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
