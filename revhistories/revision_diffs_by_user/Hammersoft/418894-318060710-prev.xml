The show was created by [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]], as a [[spin-off]] series of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' created by Wright and [[Jonathan Glassner]] after the release of ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994). The first three seasons of the television series were broadcast by [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] and [[The Movie Network]] before the series moved only to Sci Fi Channel for its last two seasons, meaning a release of 100 episodes before the series was cancelled. ''Stargate Atlantis'' premiered on Sci Fi Channel on July 16, 2004; its final episode premiered on Sci Fi Channel on January 9, 2009. The television series was filmed in and around [[Vancouver]], Canada.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
