  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;His first study of mathematics, which would later lead to its incorporation into his art works, began with [[George PÃ³lya]]'s academic paper on plane [[symmetry group]]s sent to him by his brother [[Berend George Escher|Berend]]. This paper inspired him to learn the concept of the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s (plane symmetry groups). Utilizing this mathematical concept, Escher created periodic tilings with 43 colored drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts using the concept of the 17 plane symmetry groups.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
