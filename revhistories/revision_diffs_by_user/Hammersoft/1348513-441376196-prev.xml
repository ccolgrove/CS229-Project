  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Popular legend holds that WBCN was sent a promotional copy of [[The Beatles]]' unreleased ''[[Let It Be|Get Back]]'' album and played it on the air before the release of the album was cancelled. The &quot;album&quot; had been compiled out of material the Beatles recorded in London in January 1969, the same sessions that would be used to create the Beatles' [[Let It Be (album)|''Let It Be'' album]] which was released in May 1970.  While the existence of the promotional album is apocryphal, the truth behind the broadcast, though less dramatic, is equally as fascinating.  In late summer of 1969, WBCN somehow obtained a reel-to-reel tape of a reference acetate of a potential album song lineup prepared by Beatles' engineer Glyn Johns on March 10, 1969.  WBCN aired the tape on September 22, 1969. Although WBCN was not the only radio station, or even the first station, to air material from the ''Get Back'' sessions &amp;amp;mdash; [[WWKB|WKBW]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] was the first, and the tapes also aired on [[WEBN]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[WBAI]] in [[New York City]], and [[KCOK]] in [[St. Louis]] &amp;amp;mdash; WBCN's broadcast of the tapes has been immortalized because it was preserved on a high-quality reel, which spawned several widely-circulated Beatles bootlegs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Their playlist in general was more varied than many of their competitors, there was some focus on local music (also see the [[WBCN Rock &amp;amp; Roll Rumble]]), and the station was known nationwide for breaking acts ([[The Cars]], [['Til Tuesday]], [[U2]]) and setting trends. [[Oedipus (DJ)|Oedipus]] (who had the first punk rock show in the country while at MIT's college station, [[WMBR|WTBS]]) was hired first as a DJ in 1977, and then installed as program director (1981), and helped to break [[the Ramones]], [[the Clash]], [[the Police]], and countless punk and new wave bands out of Boston.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In early 1994, WBCN made its first major format adjustment since 1968. The old DJs, station IDs, and classic rock were gutted, replaced by an [[alternative music]] format featuring new, younger jocks; on April 1, 1996, the Stern show was switched to the morning. The station lost some of its longtime listeners (who migrated to the now co-owned [[WZLX]], where former WBCN DJs Laquidara and [[Carter Alan]] had gone) but quickly gained credibility among many younger people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
