  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''''Squad Leader''''' is a [[tactical wargames|tactical]] level [[board wargame]] originally published by [[Avalon Hill]] in 1977. It was designed by Hall of Fame game designer [[John Hill (game designer)|John Hill]] and focuses on [[infantry]] combat in Europe during [[World War II]].  One of the most complex wargames of its time, ''Squad Leader'' was the natural extension of the trend towards greater realism (and hence complexity) initiated by several earlier games, including Avalon Hill's own ''[[PanzerBlitz]]'' and ''[[Panzer Leader]]''.  Those two earlier games were slightly larger in scope, with [[counter (board wargames)|counters]] representing platoons and map hexes measuring 250 metres across, compared to Squad Leader's 40 metre hexes and squad sized units.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
