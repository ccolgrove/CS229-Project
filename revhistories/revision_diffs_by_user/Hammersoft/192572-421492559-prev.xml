  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Location shooting originally occurred in the village of [[Arncliffe, North Yorkshire|Arncliffe]] in Littondale, one of the less frequented valleys of the [[Yorkshire Dales]]. In exterior shots the village's hotel, The Falcon was used to represent the fictional Woolpack Inn. Eventually the location of the shooting location became publicly known, which is perhaps what prompted the move to the village of [[Esholt]] in 1976, where it stayed for the next 22 years. This location also became a tourist attraction and the village pub (previously 'the Commercial Hotel') has retained the adopted name of [[The Woolpack|The Woolpack Inn]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
