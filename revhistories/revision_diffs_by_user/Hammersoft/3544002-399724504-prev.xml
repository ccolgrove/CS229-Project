  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Takoma Park Middle School's foundations stretch back to the historic Takoma-Silver Spring School, which was located on a 3.8-acre campus at the corner of Philadelphia Avenue and Chicago Avenue in suburban [[Takoma Park, Maryland]]. In the late 1920s, T-SSHS expanded to consist of the middle grades 7 through 9, and by the early 1930s, grades K through 12. Due to an ever growing population, the high grades (10 through 12) left the school to form [[Montgomery Blair High School]] in 1935. By the end of the 1930s, further population growth fueled the need for a new [[middle school|junior high school]]; as a result, the middle grades relocated from Takoma-Silver Spring School to the new Takoma Park Middle School in March of 1940. Takoma-Silver Spring School was then renamed Silver Spring Intermediate School (SSI), which served as an elementary school until 1972, not to be confused with [[Silver Spring International Middle School]]. In 1992, the historic SSI building was demolished and the former school campus became a community park.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
