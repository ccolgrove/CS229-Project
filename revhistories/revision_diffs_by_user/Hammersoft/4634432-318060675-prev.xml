  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a '''list of Goa'uld technologies''' in the ''[[Stargate]]'' franchise. The [[Goa'uld]] are the main adversaries for most of the run of ''Stargate SG-1''. They scavenged or conquered most of their advanced technologies from other races. However, there are innovators amongst the Goa'uld; [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] and [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] in particular have been depicted with a great deal of technological ingenuity. Rather than being designed as practical, many Goa'uld devices, such as the [[staff weapon]], are designed to have higher visual impact, meant to intimidate and reinforce their position as gods to their followers.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;The Warrior&quot;&amp;gt;{{sgcite|The Warrior|show=ref}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Some pieces of Goa'uld technology, such as the hand device and the healing device, respond only to mental commands and require naqahdah in the bloodstream of the user to operate.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Thor's Chariot&quot;&amp;gt;{{sgcite|Thor's Chariot|show=ref}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Seth&quot;&amp;gt;{{sgcite|Seth|show=ref}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
