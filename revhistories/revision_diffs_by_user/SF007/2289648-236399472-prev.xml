  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In July 2008, Microsoft introduced a web-based advertising campaign called &quot;The 'Mojave Experiment'&quot;, that depicts a group of people who are asked to evaluate the newest operating system from Microsoft, calling it Windows 'Mojave'.  Participants are first asked about Vista, if they have used it, and their overall satisfaction with Vista, on a scale of 1 to 10.  They are then shown a demo of some of the new operating system's features, and asked their opinion and satisfaction with it on the same 1 to 10 scale.  After respondents rate &quot;Mojave&quot;, they are then told, that they were really shown a demo of Windows Vista.  The object was to test &quot;A theory: If people could see Windows Vista firsthand, they would like it.&quot;  According to Microsoft, the initial sample of respondents rated Vista an average of 4.4 out of 10, and Mojave received an average of 8.5, with no respondents rating Mojave lower than they originally rated Windows Vista before the demo.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
