  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Eighth Army deeply outflanked the German defences along the Egyptian frontier with a left hook through the desert, and reached a position from which they could strike at both Tobruk and the coastal road, the &quot;Via Balbia&quot;. Auchinleck planned to engage the ''Afrika Korps'' with his armoured division, while XXX Corps assaulted the Italian positions at [[Bardia]], encircling the troops there. The British operational plan had one major flaw. When XXX corps reached the area of Qabr Salih, it was assumed that the ''Afrika Korps'' would move eastward and accept battle, allowing the British to surround them with the southerly armour thrust. Rommel, however, did not find it necessary to do as the British planned, instead attacking the southern armoured thrust at Sidi Rezegh.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Stegman, ''Germany and the Second World War â Volume III â Part V â Chapter V.VI (&quot;Operation Crusader&quot;)'', p. 729&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

He considered the risks too great if he chose to attack Tobruk, and so called off this attack.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Liddel-Hart ''The Rommel Papers'', p. 159&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
