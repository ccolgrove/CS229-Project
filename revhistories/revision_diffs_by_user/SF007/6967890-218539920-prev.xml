  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* The first type is '''application packagers''' &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Thinstall, &lt;/span&gt;Softricity) whereas the other is '''application compilers''' (Java and Dot Net). Because it is a packager, it can be used to stream applications without modifying the source code, whereas the latter can only be used to compile the source code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* The first type is '''application packagers''' &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(VMware ThinApp, &lt;/span&gt;Softricity) whereas the other is '''application compilers''' (Java and Dot Net). Because it is a packager, it can be used to stream applications without modifying the source code, whereas the latter can only be used to compile the source code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* Another way to look at is through the [[Hypervisor]] point of view. The first one is &quot;hypervisor&quot; in '''user mode''', whereas the other is &quot;hypervisor&quot; in '''runtime mode'''. The hypervisor was put in quotation, because both of them have similar behavior in that it intercepts system calls in different mode: user mode and runtime mode. The user mode intercepts the system calls from the runtime mode before going to kernel mode. The '''real hypervisor''' only needs to intercept the system call using [http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/hypercall hypercall] in kernel mode. Hopefully, once Windows have a [[Hypervisor]], [[Virtual machine monitor]], there may even be no need for JRE and CLR. Moreover, in Linux case, maybe the [[JRE]] can be modified to run on top of the Hypervisor as a [[loadable kernel module]] running in [[Linux Kernel|kernel]] mode, instead of the having the legacy runtime turtling around, running really slowly, in user mode. Now, if it were running on top of the [[Linux Hypervisor]] directly, then it should be called [[Java OS]], not just another '''runtime mode''' [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
