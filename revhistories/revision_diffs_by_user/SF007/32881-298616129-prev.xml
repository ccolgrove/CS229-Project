  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A famous event in the history of software piracy policy was an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists|open letter]] written by [[Bill Gates]] of [[Microsoft]], dated February 3, 1976, in which he argued that the quality of available software would increase if software piracy was less prevalent.  However, until the early 1990s, software piracy was not yet considered a serious problem by most people. In 1992, the [[Software Publishers Association]] began to battle against software piracy, with its promotional video &quot;[[Don't Copy That Floppy]]&quot;. It and the [[Business Software Alliance]] have remained the most active anti-piracy organizations worldwide, although to compensate for extensive growth in recent years, they have gained the assistance of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), as well as [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
