  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ''[[Unix-like]]'' family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including [[System V]], [[BSD (operating system)|BSD]], and [[Linux]]. The name &quot;[[UNIX]]&quot; is a trademark of [[The Open Group]] which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions. &quot;Unix-like&quot; is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original Unix.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of machine architectures. They are used heavily for [[Server (computing)|servers]] in business, as well as [[workstation]]s in academic and engineering environments. [[Free software]] Unix variants, such as [[GNU]], [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], are popular in these areas. The market share for Linux is divided between many different [[Linux distribution|distributions]].  Enterprise class distributions by [[Red Hat]] or [[Novell]] are used by corporations, but some home users may use those products. Historically home users typically installed a distribution themselves, but in 2007 [[Dell]] began to offer the [[Ubuntu &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] &lt;/span&gt;Linux distribution on home PCs. Linux on the desktop is also popular in the developer and [[hobbyist]] [[operating system development]] communities. (see below)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Market share statistics for freely available operating systems are usually inaccurate since most free operating systems are not purchased, making usage under-represented. On the other hand, market share statistics based on total downloads of free operating systems are often inflated, as there is no economic disincentive to acquire multiple operating systems so users can download multiple systems, test them, and decide which they like best.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
