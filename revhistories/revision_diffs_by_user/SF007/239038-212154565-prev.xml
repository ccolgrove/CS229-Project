  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms. In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an &quot;architecture&quot; or &quot;construction management&quot; firm may have experts from all related fields as employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may offer itself as &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for a construction project, from beginning to end.  This is designated as a &quot;design Build&quot; contract where the contractor is given a performance specification, and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering, and construction management.  In general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers, and constructors throughout design and construction.  In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone, and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
