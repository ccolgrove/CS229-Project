  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At her funeral, the team grieve. Once they've left the chapel (and [[Bob Hogan]] has checked the body to make sure she's dead), Adam injects her with an antidote - he had in fact switched the serum Juliette used on her with a sedative which feigned the appearance of death. She awakes, but because Adam knows Yalta would hunt her down if they knew she was alive, he sends her off with a passport, some money and clothes. They share a tearful goodbye. Adam then joins everyone outside in the courtyard to mourn with the others. Jo sheds a tear, but out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ros walking off and, glad that Ros is safe, she smiles and looks at Adam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

She attempted to shake off the Russian car following her, but then lost patience, got out of her car to get to the attack site and physically assaulted and defeated her Russian pursuer in the square outside the [[London Guildhall]].  Arriving at the attack site, she briefly met Adam before he died in driving a car-bomb away from the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Remembrance Day &lt;/span&gt;service being attacked.  In the following episode she asked Harry to replace Adam as head of Section D, stating that Adam's death had not affected her, though shortly afterwards she took out her anger on the flat she was staying in.  She then returned to work in a reasonably calm fashion and at the end of the episode was confirmed by Harry as the new Section D head.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
