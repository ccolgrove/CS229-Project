  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Open Source unix-based alternatives include [http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/ dd_rescue] and [http://www.kalysto.org/utilities/dd_rhelp/index.en.html dd_rhelp], which work together, or [http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html GNU ddrescue]. dd_rhelp first extracts all the readable data, and saves it to a file, inserting zeros where bytes cannot be read. Then it tries to re-read the invalid data and update this file.  GNU ddrescue can be used to copy data directly to a new disk if needed, just like Linux [[Dd (Unix)|dd]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;dd_rhelp or GNU ddrescue will yield a complete disk image, faster but possibly with some errors. GNU ddrescue is generally much faster, as it is written entirely in C++, whereas dd_rhelp is a shell script wrapper around dd_rescue. Both dd_rhelp and GNU ddrescue aim to copy data fast where there are no errors, then copy in smaller blocks and with retries where there are errors.  They are more complicated to use than SpinRite, but GNU ddrescue is quite easy to use with default options, and can easily be downloaded and compiled on Linux-based &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[LiveDistro|Live CDs]] &lt;/span&gt;such as [[Knoppix]], and can be used with [[SystemRescueCD]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many files on a disk may be damaged. In practice most damaged files may be unimportant: temporary files, files which are easily replaced by reinstalling software, and so on. Executable program files are not worth rescuing unless they are guaranteed 100% correct. Some documents may be worth rescuing even incomplete. Any sector-based rescue system is bound to spend a lot of its time trying to read unwanted data. A file-based system which allows the user to skip files which are a waste of time (and lists files which could not be recovered) can be more practical. Ultimately a sector-based program which reads data in raw format and uses other tricks may recover more data.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
