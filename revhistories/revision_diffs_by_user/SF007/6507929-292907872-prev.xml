  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several programs make use of self-extracting archives. For [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] there is [[WinZip]], [[WinRAR]], [[7-Zip]], and the built-in [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb496379.aspx IExpress Wizard]. For [[Macintosh]] there is [[StuffIt]], [[The Unarchiver]], and [[7zX]]. There are also programs (like [http://www.megastep.org/makeself/ makeself]) that create self-extracting archives on [[Unix]] as [[shell scripts]]. An early example of a self-extracting archive was the Unix [[shar]] archive, in which one or more text files were combined into a shell script that when executed recreated the original files.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Distributing and receiving files which appear to be self-extracting archives can be dangerous, as the file itself may contain malicious code, like [[computer virus|viruses]] or [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;For this reason, many internet users do not accept self-extracting archive files and would rather receive regular compressed file archives without any executable code. &lt;/span&gt;Fortunately, many archivers are capable of working with self-extracting archives as if they were regular archives.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
