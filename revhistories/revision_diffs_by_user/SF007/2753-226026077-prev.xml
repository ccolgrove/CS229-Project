  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;AutoCAD's native file format, [[.dwg|DWG]], and to a lesser extent, its interchange file format, [[DXF]], have become [[de facto]] standards for CAD data [[interoperability]]. AutoCAD in recent years has included support for [[DWF]], a format developed and promoted by Autodesk for publishing CAD data. In 2006, Autodesk estimated the number of active DWG files to be in excess of one billion. In the past, Autodesk has estimated the total number of DWG files in existence to be more than three billion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;AutoCAD currently runs exclusively on [[Microsoft]] desktop [[operating system]]s. Versions for [[Unix]] and [[Macintosh]] were released in the 1980s and 1990s, but these were later dropped. AutoCAD can run on an [[emulator]] or [[compatibility layer]] like &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Virtual PC]] &lt;/span&gt;or [[Wine (software)|Wine]], albeit subject to various performance issues that can often arise when working with 3D objects or large drawings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
