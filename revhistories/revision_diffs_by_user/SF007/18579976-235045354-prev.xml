  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ultimate Edition started off as Ubuntu Christmas Edition. Due to the popularity of Christmas edition, the creator TheeMahn created Ubuntu Ultimate 1.1.  Ubuntu Ultimate is Ubuntu (a Debian based distribution) with additional software pre-installed and ready for use even in the live CD/DVD environment. Ubuntu Ultimate came standard with the codecs needed to play various proprietary media formats, including MP3 support.  Ubuntu Ultimate 1.2 was released shortly after 1.1 with new software and support for dual core processors.  To answer the call of gamers, TheeMahn then built Ubuntu Ultimate Gamers Edition.  Gamers Edition came with a large variety of games for Linux. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On Oct 18, 2007, TheeMahn received an e-mail from Canonical &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;demanding &lt;/span&gt;that the use of the Ubuntu logo and name stop.  The reason was that Ubuntu Ultimate had become too different from Ubuntu and that continued use of the name and logo may damage the Ubuntu Project.  Ubuntu Ultimate then became '''Ultimate Edition'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
