  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Two types of attack scenarios exist in which it is possible to maliciously take advantage of this bootkit, currently written for Win32 platforms only: in the first one, the user is required to [[Execution_(computing)|launch]] the bootkit with administrative privileges once the PC has already [[booting|booted]] into Windows; in the second one, analogously to [[hardware keylogger|hardware keyloggers]], a malicious person needs physical access &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(legally as in the case of [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], or illegally as in the case of [[industrial espionage]] activities) &lt;/span&gt;to the user's Truecrypt-encrypted hard disk: in this context this is needed to modify the user's Truecrypt MBR with the Stoned's one and then place the hard disk back on the unknowing user's PC, so that when the user boots the PC and types his/her Truecrypt password on boot, the &quot;Stoned&quot; bootkit intercepts it thereafter because, from that moment on, the Stoned bootkit is loaded before Truecrypt's MBR in the boot sequence. The first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices, i.e. avoid running non-trusted [[executable|executables]] with administrative privileges; the second one can be successfully neutralized - by the side of a user who suspect his/her encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone he/she doesn't trust - by booting the encrypted operating system with Truecrypt's Rescue Disk instead of booting it directly from the hard disk.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://peterkleissner.com/?p=11 | title = TrueCrypt Foundation is a joke to the security industry, pro Microsoft | publisher = Peter Kleissner | work = Peter Kleissner post and expert comments about Stoned bootkit | accessdate = 2009-08-05 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
