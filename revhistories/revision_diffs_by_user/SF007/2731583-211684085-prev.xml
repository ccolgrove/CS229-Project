  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A key element of Hitler's appeal was his ability to evoke a sense of offended national pride caused by the Treaty of Versailles imposed on the defeated [[Second Reich|German Empire]] by the Western Allies. Germany had lost economically important territory in Europe along with its colonies and in admitting to sole responsibility for the war had agreed to pay a huge [[World War I reparations|reparations]] bill totaling 132 billion [[German gold mark|marks]]. Most Germans bitterly resented these terms, but early Nazi attempts to gain support by blaming these humiliations on &quot;international Jewry&quot; were not particularly successful with the electorate. The party learned quickly, and soon a more subtle propaganda emerged, combining anti-Semitism with an attack on the failures of the &quot;Weimar system&quot; and the parties supporting it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Having failed in overthrowing the Republic by a coup, Hitler pursued a &quot;strategy of legality&quot;: this meant formally adhering to the rules of the Weimar Republic until he had legally gained power.  He would then use the institutions of the Weimar Republic to destroy it and establish himself as dictator.  Some party members, especially in the paramilitary [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], opposed this strategy; RÃ¶hm ridiculed Hitler as &quot;Adolphe LegalitÃ©&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
