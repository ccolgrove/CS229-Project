  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north and west and a nominally independent state in the south, to be based in the spa town of [[Vichy]], dubbed [[Vichy France]]. The new French state, headed by PÃ©tain, accepted its status as a defeated nation and attempted to buy favor with the Germans through accommodation and passivity. Charles de Gaulle, who had been made an Undersecretary of National Defense by Reynaud, in London at the time of the surrender, made his [[Appeal of 18 June]]. In this broadcast he refused to recognize the Vichy government as legitimate and began the task of organizing the [[Free French]] forces. Numerous French colonies abroad ([[French Guiana]], [[French Equatorial Africa]]) joined de Gaulle rather than the Vichy government.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
