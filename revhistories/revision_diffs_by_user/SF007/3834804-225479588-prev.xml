A &quot;miniEd&quot; is normally introduced a week or two after a DVD release, although it is not always true for every single version (they are available for major ones, certainly). Recently though, the team has announced that testing will be open in the future, so this time frame may differ. As they are released later than their DVD counterparts, they are likely to include bug fixes and minor improvements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
