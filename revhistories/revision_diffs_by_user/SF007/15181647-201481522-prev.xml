  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In September 2007, a relationship between Marsden and an [[Ontario Provincial Police]] officer ended. She posted his photo and identified him on her blog as an anti-terrorism officer who had leaked secret anti-terrorism documents to her. At the same time, in an email to his superiors, she described the nationality and activities of the targets of an investigation in Ontario involving the OPP, [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and problems encountered by those investigators. The officer filed a complaint of criminal harassment against Marsden with the South [[Simcoe, Ontario|Simcoe]] Police but this did not result in criminal charges. The OPP's criminal investigations branch cleared the officer of any and all wrongdoing with regard to Marsden's accusations of leaking classified information. A separate internal investigation into the matter is currently ongoing. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/03/12/wales-wikipedia.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On more than one occasion Marsden asked [[Wikipedia]] to delete her [[biography]] on the site. Her concerns led her to contact Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] in 2006, claiming that it was wrong and libellous. He reviewed her biography and, deeming that it was not up to standard, helped to clean up the entry. Wales announced in a statement on Wikipedia &quot;My involvement in cases like this is completely routine, and I am proud of it.&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=smh/&amp;gt; On [[February 29]], [[2008]], the technology gossip blog [[Valleywag]] claimed that they had entered into a relationship, and published instant messaging chats that they had allegedly exchanged. On the following day Wales announced on his Wikipedia user page that he was no longer involved with her. In return, Marsden, who claimed to have learned about the breakup by reading about it on the Internet, turned to [[eBay]] and put up for auction a [[t-shirt]] and sweater that she claimed belonged &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;be &lt;/span&gt;Wales.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
