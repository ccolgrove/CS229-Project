  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''iOS jailbreaking''', or &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;simply '''jailbreaking''', &lt;/span&gt;is the process of removing the limitations imposed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] on [[device]]s running the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[operating system]], which was known as &quot;iPhone OS&quot; prior to iOS 4.0. Such devices include [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and recently [[Apple TV]]. Jailbreaking allows users to gain full access (or [[root access]]) to the operating system, thereby unlocking all its features. Once jailbroken, iOS users are able to download additional applications, extensions and themes that are unavailable through the official [[Apple App Store]], via installers such as [[Cydia (application)|Cydia]], one of a number of current means for older iPhones. A jailbroken [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] or [[iPod Touch]] running [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] can still use the App Store and [[iTunes]] and other normal functions, such as making telephone calls. Unlike [[Rooting (Android OS)|rooting]] an Android device, jailbreaking is necessary if the user intends to run software not authorized by Apple.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
