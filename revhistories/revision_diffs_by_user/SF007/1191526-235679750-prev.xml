  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Linux-VServer is a [[jail (computer security)|jail mechanism]] in that it can be used to securely partition resources on a computer system (such as the [[file system]], CPU time, network addresses and memory) in such a way that [[process (computing)|processes]] cannot mount a [[denial-of-service attack]] on anything outside their partition.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

A [[chroot]]-like utility for descending into security contexts is provided.  Booting a virtual private server is then simply a matter of kickstarting [[init]] in a new security context;  likewise, shutting it down simply entails killing all processes with that security context.  The contexts themselves are robust enough to boot many [[Linux distribution]]s unmodified, including [[Debian]] and [[Fedora Core]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Virtual private servers are commonly used in [[web hosting]] services, where they are useful for segregating customer accounts, pooling resources and containing any potential security breaches.  To save space on such installations, each virtual server's file system can be created as a tree of [[copy-on-write]] [[hard link]]s to a &quot;template&quot; file system.  The hard link is marked with a special filesystem attribute and when modified, is securely and transparently replaced with a real copy of the file.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
