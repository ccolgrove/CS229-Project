  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the 1970s, the gang had tenuous alliances to the city's two major white gangs, the [[Popes (gang)| Popes]] and the [[Chicago Gaylords|Gaylords]]. In 1975, the Gaylords killed [[Larkin]], then the leader of the Popes, and the Popes decided to form an alliance with the Royals. The Royals also fought major &quot;wars&quot; with the Latin Kings, [[Insane Deuces]] and [[Latin Eagles]] in which many lives were lost, including some of the top ranking Simon City Royals. By this time the Royals had spread out to include neighborhoods like Albany and School, Drake and Wolfram, Southport and Fullerton, Central Park and Wilson, California and Fletcher, Farwell and Clark, among others. The Southport and Fullerton Royals were involved in a &quot;war&quot; with the [[Insane Unknowns]] because they had killed the leader of the Unknowns after inviting him to a peace meeting. The Unknowns would then wipe out the Southport and Fullerton Royals, killing their leaders and taking control of the area. To protect their members in prison and to maintain some presence on the streets, the Royals opted to join the [[Folk Nation]] which sprang up in the late 70s/early 80s. The leader of the Simon City Royals, Todd O'Thomas, aka Todd Brewer, was killed by the [[Puerto Rican Stones]] in the early 80s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Royals entered into vicious street wars with the Latin Kings, Insane Deuces and Gaylords. In 1983, the Royals shot a 14 year old Gaylord in the back, killing him. One of the Gaylords present was Michael Scott, who would later go on to write a book about his days as a [[gang member]] called [http://www.gaylords712.com/book.html &quot;Lords of Lawndale&quot;]. Scott and others identified a Royal named Mike Hynes as the shooter and testified against him in court; also damaging testimony coming from fellow Simon City Royal members. Hynes and Orlando Serrano, who claimed to not be a gang member, was accused of being the driver of the getaway car, and additionally tried for murder. Serrano was found Not Guilty. Hynes was convicted by a jury. Hynes spent over twenty years in prison and was killed shortly after his release after being involved in the stabbing of a woman in a Chicago bar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
