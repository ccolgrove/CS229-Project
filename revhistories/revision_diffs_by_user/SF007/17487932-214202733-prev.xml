  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* Sondonesia, a country in [[South East Asia]]. Said to be undergoing a civil war or a war for independence, with rebels for hire. [[Rastapopoulos]]'s hired gun, [[Allan Thompson|Allan]], recruits Sondonesians as gun-toting muscle in ''[[Flight 714]]''. They appear to be thinly disguised [[Khmer Rouge]] or the [[East Timor]] fighters for independence, and HergÃ©'s insistence that Sondonesia is in a state of civil war shows amazing clarity of vision as to the true state of the conflict in [[Cambodia]] at that period. The name Sondonesia is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Sunda]] and [[Indonesia]]. However, the location of the Kemajoran airport of Jakarta and the latest radio message from 'Makassar' before the plane was hijacked to one of the Sondonesian islands suggests that the location itself is not far from the Malay/Indonesian archipelago. Herge gave further evidence by some 'Sondonesian' conversations (the angry sailor on the boat, and the two bunker guards) which were spoken in Indonesian Malay. One point very clear is that in the book appear a Proboscis monkey (similar nose to Rastapopoulos as Allan figure &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;out)this &lt;/span&gt;species is exclusive of Borneo island.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
