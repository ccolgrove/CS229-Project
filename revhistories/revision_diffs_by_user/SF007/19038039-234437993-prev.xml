The two primary contenders were the [[House of Valois]], and the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The House of Valois claimed the title of King of France, while the Plantagenets from England claimed to be Kings of France and England. The Plantagenet Kings in England, also known as the House of Anjou, had their roots in the French regions of [[Anjou]] and [[Normandy]]. French soldiers fought on both sides, with [[Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]] providing notable support for the Plantagenet side.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Subtracting the two long periods of peace from 1360â69 and 1389â1415, the war was fought for about 81 years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
