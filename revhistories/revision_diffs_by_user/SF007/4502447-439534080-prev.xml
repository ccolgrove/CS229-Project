  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A hybrid disc has multiple [[file system]]s installed on it, typically [[ISO 9660]] and [[HFS+]] (or [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] on older discs). The reason for the format is primarily that ISO 9660 has severe [[ISO_9660#Restrictions|restrictions]] placed on [[filename]]s (initially only 8 characters per file, and a depths of 3 directories, similar to the [[Microsoft]] [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] filesystem.) and lacks key structures present in [[Apple Computer]]'s HFS and HFS+ file systems. Another key factor is that ISO 9660 does not support [[resource fork]]s, which is critical to [[Mac OS]]' software design ([[Mac OS X]] has removed much of the emphasis/need for resource forks in application design). Companies that released products for both [[DOS]] (later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]) and [[Mac OS]] (later [[Mac OS X]]) could release a CD containing software for both, natively readable on either system. Data files can even be shared by both partitions, while keeping the platform specific data separate. In a ''true'' (or ''shared'') hybrid HFS filesystem, files common to both the ISO 9660 and HFS partitions are stored only once, with the ISO 9660 partition pointing to file content in the HFS area (or vice versa). [[Blizzard Entertainment]] has released most of their computer games on hybrid CDs. By default, [[Mac OS 9]] and [[Mac OS X]] burn hybrid discs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A hybrid disc has an ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor, which makes it a valid ISO 9660 disc, and an Apple partition. It may also have an [[Apple partition map]], although this is not necessary. The ISO 9660 portion of the disc can co-exist with an Apple partition because the header areas which define the contents of the disc are located in different places. The ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor begins &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;32,768 &lt;/span&gt;bytes (32KB) into the disc. If present, an Apple partition map begins 512 bytes into the disc; if there is no partition map, the header for an Apple [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] partition (known as a Master Directory Block, or MDB) begins 1,024 bytes into the disc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
