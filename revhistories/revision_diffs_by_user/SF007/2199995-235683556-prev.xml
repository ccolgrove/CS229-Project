  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Availability, price and employee familiarity often determines which operating systems are offered on dedicated servers. Variations of [[Linux]] ([[open source]] [[operating systems]]) are often included at no charge to the customer. Commercial operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server, provided through a special program called Microsoft SPLA. Red Hat Enterprise is a commercial version of Linux offered to hosting providers on a monthly fee basis. The monthly fee provides OS updates through the [[Red Hat Network]] using an application called up2date. Other operating systems are available from the open source community at no charge. These include [[CentOS]], [[Fedora Core]], [[Debian]], and many other Linux distributions or BSD systems [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Support for any of the operating systems above typically depends on the level of management offered with a particular dedicated server plan. Operating system support may include updates to the core system in order to acquire the latest security fixes, patches, and system-wide vulnerability resolutions. Updates to core operating systems include kernel upgrades, service packs, application updates, and security patches that keep server secure and safe. Operating system updates and support relieves the burden of server management from the dedicated server owner.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
