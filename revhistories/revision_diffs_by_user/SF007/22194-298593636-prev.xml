  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ''[[Unix-like]]'' family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including [[System V]], [[BSD (operating system)|BSD]], and [[Linux kernel|Linux]]. The name &quot;[[UNIX]]&quot; is a trademark of [[The Open Group]] which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions. &quot;Unix-like&quot; is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original Unix.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
