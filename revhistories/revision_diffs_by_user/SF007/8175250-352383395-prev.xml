  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Besides [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] to existing host [[network card|network adapters]], [[CD-ROM]] devices, [[hard disk]] drives, and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] devices (including USB Isochronous devices such as [[webcam]]s, microphones etc), VMware Workstation also provides the ability to simulate some hardware. For example, it can [[mount (computing)|mount]] an [[ISO image|ISO]] file as a CD-ROM, and [[.vmdk]] files as hard disks; and can configure its network adapter driver to use [[network address translation]] (NAT) through the host machine rather than bridging through it (which would require an IP address for each guest machine on the host network).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;VMware Workstation also allows the testing of [[live CD]]s without first [[CD &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;recorder|burning]] &lt;/span&gt;them onto physical discs or [[reboot]]ing the computer. One can also take multiple successive snapshots of an operating system running under VMware Workstation. Each snapshot allows you to roll back the virtual machine to the saved status at any time. The ability to use multiple snapshots makes VMware Workstation useful as a tool for salespersons demonstrating complex software products, and for developers setting up virtual development or test environments. VMware Workstation includes the ability to designate multiple virtual machines as a team which administrators can then power on and off, suspend, and resume as a single object â making it particularly useful for testing client-server environments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
