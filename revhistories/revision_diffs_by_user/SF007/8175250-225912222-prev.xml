  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''VMware Workstation''' is a [[virtual machine]] software suite for [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] computers from [[VMware]], a division of [[EMC Corporation]]. This software suite allows users to set up multiple x86 and x86-64 virtual computers and to use one or more of these virtual machines simultaneously with the hosting [[operating system]]. Each virtual machine instance can execute its own guest operating system, such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BSD|BSD variants]], or others. In simple terms, VMware Workstation allows one physical machine to run multiple operating systems simultaneously. Other VMware products help manage or migrate VMware virtual machines across multiple host-machines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Besides [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] to existing host [[network card|network adapter]]s, [[CD-ROM]] devices, [[hard disk|hard-disk]] drives, and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] devices, VMware Workstation also provides the ability to simulate some hardware. For example, it can [[mount (computing)|mount]] an [[ISO image|ISO]] file as a CD-ROM, and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;.vmdk &lt;/span&gt;files  as hard disks; and can configure its network adapter driver to use [[network address translation]] (NAT) through the host-machine rather than bridging through it (which would require an IP address for each guest-machine on the host network).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;VMware Workstation also allows the testing of [[Live CD]]s without first [[CD recorder|burning]] them onto physical discs or [[reboot]]ing the computer. One can also take multiple successive snapshots of an operating system running under VMware Workstation. Each snapshot allows you to roll back the virtual machine to the saved status at any time. The ability to use multiple snapshots  makes VMware Workstation useful as a tool for sales-people demonstrating complex software products, and for developers setting up virtual development-environments and virtual test-environments. VMware Workstation includes the ability to designate multiple virtual machines as a team which administrators can then power on and off, suspend, and resume as a single object â making it particularly useful for testing client-server environments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
