  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Reverse discrimination''' is a controversial term referring to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;discrimination &lt;/span&gt;against members of a dominant or majority group, including the city or state, or in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Groups may be defined in terms of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], or other factors. This discrimination may seek to redress [[social inequalities]] where minority groups have been denied access to the same privileges of the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. Reverse discrimination may also be used to highlight the discrimination inherent in [[affirmative action]] programs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
