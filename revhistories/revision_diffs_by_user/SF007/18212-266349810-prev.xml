  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Because most of the kernel and supporting packages are some combination of [[free software]] and [[open-source software|open source]], Linux distributions have taken a wide variety of forms â from fully featured desktop and server operating systems to minimal environments (typically for use in [[embedded system]]s, or for [[booting]] from a floppy disk). Aside from certain custom software (such as installers and configuration tools) a distribution simply refers to a particular assortment of applications installed on top of a set of libraries married with a version of the kernel, such that its &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; capabilities meets most of the needs of its particular end-user base.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
