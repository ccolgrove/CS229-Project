  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Upon the launch of the T-Mobile G1, one concern among developers was that the retail build of Android installed on it lacked certain features (such as the &quot;su&quot; command) that were available on the Developer Phone version that allowed you to obtain superuser access to the phone. This had a number of implications, the most important being that it prevented you from changing large parts of the firmware (since they were mounted read-only on boot, and only the superuser could remount them read-write). However, a severe vulnerability was soon discovered in early versions of the firmware â everything typed into the phone's keyboard was being interpreted as commands in a root shell.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=680 Zdnet.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; By using [[telnet]]d to exploit this, users could flash a modified image with root access.

Although Google and T-Mobile were quick to patch this vulnerability with update RC30, a ROM from HTC was later leaked allowing users to downgrade to an older firmware with the bug.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://andblogs.net/2009/01/rc30-downgrade-merry-christmas-everyone/ Andblogs.net]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Android Dev Phone 1 comes with superuser access officially integrated into its firmware, allowing native code and custom kernels to be run without any special hacks.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://android.brightstarcorp.com/ Brightstarcorp.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rooting also allows the use of modified images to run on the G1 through the original vulnerability. For example, a leaked [[HTC Magic]] (Android 1.5) OS was modified to run on the device before the official Android 1.5 build for the HTC Dream was released. This enabled functionality such as video recording, stereo [[Bluetooth]] and an on-screen keyboard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
