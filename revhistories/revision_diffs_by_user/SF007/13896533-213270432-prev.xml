Details are scarce, but we are told that the enemy is a totalitarian Asiatic superpower known as &quot;the [[Yellow Empire]],&quot; ruled by the Emperor Basam Damdu, and that the Yellow Empire and the free world have been locked in a cold war for the past three years.  Within the first few pages of the book, the Yellow launch a worldwide aggression with rockets, bombers and paratroopers that quickly destroy and conquer the world's other major powers.  However, the British military has been secretly working on a new type of superweapon known as the Swordfish, in anticipation of the war; when the Yellow attack is launched, the two protagonists, Captain Francis Blake, a British officer, and Professor Phillip Mortimer, the scientist developing the Swordfish, escape with the superweapon's plans and seek asylum at a secret base where they will be able to finish their work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The rest of the episode follows their attempts to escape the pursuing Yellow forces, led by the cunning and conniving Colonel Olrik, Basam Damdu's chief of security.  They initially escape from Britain in a jet-powered airplane known as the &quot;Golden Rocket,&quot; but are shot down somewhere over Iran by Yellow interceptors.  They must continue the trek to the Strait of Hormuz on foot.  Along the way, they encounter resistance fighter Ahmed Nasir, who becomes an invaluable help to them, and finally seek refuge in a small town in the [[Herat province]].  One of their hosts there betrays them, however; the episode ends with the Yellow storming the city but finding the two Britishers gone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The first one picks up right where &quot;Ruthless Pursuit&quot; left off.  The enraged Yellow commander orders his troops to search the city until they find Blake and Mortimer; however, he then executes one of the community's elders when the latter refuses to cooperate.  This sparks an immediate insurrection in which the outraged townsmen quickly massacre the Yellow troops; in the ensuing chaos, Blake and Mortimer emerge from hiding and take off again, still with Nasir helping them.  Eventually, the three of them make it to the Strait of Hormuz, but Blake is injured and loses the documents while trying to escape a Yellow patrol.  Mortimer then tells Nasir to take Blake to safety, while he returns to search for the plans.  He is himself then captured by Yellow troops, but not before he is able to find and conceal the plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second half of the episode begins three months later, with Colonel Olrik making a report to the high council of the Yellow Empire.  It is clear that the Yellow are having a lot of trouble controlling their new empire; rebellions, dissident movements and acts of terrorism have continued worldwide, and despite their best efforts, the Yellow have still not been able to sweat the Swordfish plans out of Mortimer.  As chief of security for the Empire, Olrik is the natural scapegoat for this state of affairs; he therefore decides to take the gloves completely off and torture Mortimer as harshly as necessary, hoping that his confession will help save Olrik.  Under instructions from Nasir, who has managed to infiltrate the detention center, Mortimer pretends to relent, and agrees to reconstitute the Swordfish plans for the Yellow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

They now have two urgent priorities; first, to find the lost plans and second, to break Mortimer out of prison.  The first problem is resolved when Mortimer is able to pass a message to Nasir telling him where he hid the plans.  Soon after this, Mortimer almost manages a prison break on his own; before the Yellow are able to capture him, he is rescued by Blake and Nasir personally, who then take him to a submarine and manage to escape, despite the Yellow navy and air force's best efforts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In the first pages, British commandos attack and capture a Yellow train taking imprisoned scientists to a forced labor camp.  The scientists are freed and taken back to the Hormuz base, where they also begin to work on the Swordfish project.  Soon after this, acts of sabotage begin to disrupt the base, and Blake suspects that one of the captured scientists was actually a Yellow mole.  This is eventually revealed to be none other than Olrik himself, who personally undertook the operation in an attempt to reestablish his reputation in the eyes of the high council.  Olrik manages to escape from the base despite Blake's best efforts, and the British are faced with an imminent Yellow invasion.  Mortimer suggests a drastic solution; concentrate all the base's efforts on the assembly of two working Swordfish, which should be enough to destroy a Yellow invasion force.  He estimates thirty hours before this can be done, and Admiral Grey gives him his word that the base will hold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next morning, a vast Yellow task force, composed of an aircraft carrier battle group and a number of land and air forces, appears and surrounds the base.  The initial attacks are defeated and turned back by the heroic efforts of the British.  However, Olrik then deploys new chemical weapons against which gas masks are ineffective; these allow the Yellow to gain a foothold, and they slowly begin to work their way inwards.  However, both Mortimer and Grey keep their word, and the two Swordfish (designated SX1 and SX2, hence the title) are finished in time.  The weapons, piloted by Blake and Mortimer, are unleashed and destroy the Yellow task force in minutes, though one of them is lost in combat.  The base is saved, and Sir William Grey launches a radio call to the resistance movements of the world telling them the news and urging them to strike.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
