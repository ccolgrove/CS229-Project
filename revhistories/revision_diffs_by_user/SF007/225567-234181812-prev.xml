  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, with the release of [[Debian]] ''Sarge'' in [[2005]], along with the emergence of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (a Debian based distro offered at no cost, with the option to purchase support), Libranet received less attention from the market.  Debian itself revamped their [[Debian-Installer|installer]] making it easier to use (before this, a good reason to use a Debian-based distribution was that Debian's own installer was not user friendly).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
