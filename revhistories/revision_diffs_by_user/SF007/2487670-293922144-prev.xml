  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Under [[NEXTSTEP]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[GNUstep]], a '''bundle''' is a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] that allows related resources such as [[software]] [[object file|code]] to be grouped together. They were introduced into the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] world as ''packages'' in [[Mac OS 9]] and are similar in concept to the [[Application Directory|Application Directories]] used in [[RISC OS]] and on the [[ROX Desktop]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Application software|Applications]], [[Application framework|frameworks]], and [[plugin]]s are most commonly grouped as bundles, although documents can also be grouped as bundles.  They are manipulated with the &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;NSBundle&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt; class in the NeXT Foundation kit, and with &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;CFBundle&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt; under [[Core Foundation]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A bundle usually contains one file representing executable code, and files that represent resources such as [[Interface Builder#Nib files|nibs]], images, sounds, and other media. On other systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]], these resources are usually included directly in the executable file itself at compile time. On older Macintoshes, a similar technique is used, where additional [[metadata]] can be added to a file's [[resource fork]]. Beginning with the Mac OS X, however, the [[NEXTSTEP]] concept of bundles was adopted for this purpose. Most types of bundles are used and interacted with as though they were ordinary files on the system in an attempt to reduce accidental tampering. A bundle also aims to ease problems associated with organizing resources by using a more simple structure of [[hierarchical]] directories rather than the resource fork.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
