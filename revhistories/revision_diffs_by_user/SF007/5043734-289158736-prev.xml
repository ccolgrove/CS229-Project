Because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Historian [[Roy Rosenzweig]] noted: &quot;Overall, writing is the [[Achilles' heel]] of Wikipedia. Committees rarely write well, and Wikipedia entries often have a choppy quality that results from the stringing together of sentences or paragraphs written by different people.&quot;&amp;lt;ref name=Rosenzweig&amp;gt;{{cite web&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
