  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rastapopoulos is a [[Greek American]] tycoon also known under the fake name ''Marquis di Gorgonzola''.  He is [[Tintin and Snowy|Tintin]]'s arch-nemesis, who first appeared anonymously in ''[[Tintin in America]]'' at a banquet in [[Chicago]]. His first major appearance is in ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' (serialized in &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;''Le &lt;/span&gt;Petit &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;VingtiÃ¨me'' &lt;/span&gt;from [[December 8]], [[1932]] to [[February 8]], [[1934]]), initially as a seemingly sympathetic film producer. There are, however, hints within the story to his villainous identity.  When the poet Zloty is poisoned he stammers that the leader of the criminal organisation has some connection with &quot;film&quot;.  At the end of the book a newspaper page displays a photo of the [[Thomson and Thompson|Thompson twins]] falling over a staircase.  To the left of the photo an article can be glimpsed revealing that Rastapopoulos has &quot;gone missing&quot;. However, it is not until the dÃ©nouement of ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', the follow-up to ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'', that Rastapopoulos is openly revealed to be the head of the sinister [[opium]]-cartel against which Tintin has been pitting his wits for two books. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rastapopoulos is the owner of Cosmos Pictures (Production in some titles) a studio house, and a front for many of his illegal activities and a good excuse for moving to various locations. Rastapopoulos subsequently resurfaces in the guise of the Marquis di Gorgonzola, a [[slave trade]]r in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'', and later kidnaps the billionaire [[Minor characters in The Adventures of Tintin#Laszlo Carreidas|Laszlo Carreidas]] in ''[[Flight 714]]'' to gain the password to his multi-billion Swiss Bank account, but he is captured by aliens. In the [[unfinished work|unfinished]] ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'', a character often thought to be Rastapopoulos in disguise -- under the name of Endaddine Akass -- appears. Although a page revealing Akass to be Rastapopoulos was started (and printed in the 2004 [[Egmont]] edition), as the book was never completed, Rastapopoulos' fate following ''Flight 714'' is unknown.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
