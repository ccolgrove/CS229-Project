  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Remastering''' (the term is taken from the [[remaster|audio production]] process) is the process of customizing a software distribution for personal or &quot;off-label&quot; usage (and often distribution, depending on the legalities involved). It is particularly associated with the [[Linux]] distribution world (most Linux distributions have been started by remastering (most notably [[Slackware]] from [[SLS Linux]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]], [[Mandriva]], and [[TurboLinux]] from [[Red Hat Linux]]). The term was popularized by Klaus Knopper, creator of the [[Knoppix]] &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[LiveDistro]], &lt;/span&gt;which has traditionally encouraged its users to [[hack (technology slang)|hack]] the distribution in this manner to suit their needs; appropriately, Knoppix itself is a remaster of [[Debian GNU/Linux]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
