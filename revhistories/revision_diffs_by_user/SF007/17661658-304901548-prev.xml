The virtual environment presented to the client is a merged view of the underlying physical and virtual resources, thereby allowing the virtualization layer to fool the application into thinking that it is running as if it were fully installed.  ThinApp does not have any pre-installed components and does not require the installation of device drivers allowing applications to run from USB keys or network shares without ever requiring Administrator rights.  ThinApp converts standard application installers such as .msi files into self-contained EXE files which includes everything required to run.  Unlike self-extracting ZIP files, ThinApp does not extract files to disk or require system registry changes in order to run applications.  ThinApp supports all released Intel-based Windows systems from Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, Server 2008, Terminal Server 2000 &amp;amp; 2008 from both 32bit and 64 bit editions.  ThinApp does not yet support &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;the Windows 7 Release Candidate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
