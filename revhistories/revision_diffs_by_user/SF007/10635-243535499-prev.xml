  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users. Software development for the [[GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of &quot;[[copyleft]]&quot;, designed to ensure software freedom for all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Free software is a widespread international concept, producing software used by individuals, large organizations, and governmental administrations. Free software has a very high market penetration in server-side Internet applications such as the [[Apache web server]], [[MySQL]] database, and [[PHP]] scripting language. Completely free computing environments are available as large packages of basic system software, such as the many [[GNU/Linux distribution]]s and [[FreeBSD]]. Free software [[Software development|developers]] have also created free versions of almost all commonly used desktop applications, including Web browsers, office productivity suites, and multimedia players. It is important to note, however, that in many categories, free software for individual [[workstation]]s or home users has only a fraction of the market share of its proprietary competitors. Most free software is distributed [[online]] without charge, or [[off-line]] at the [[marginal cost]] of distribution, but this pricing model is not required, and people may sell copies of free software programs for any price.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
