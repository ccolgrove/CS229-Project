  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Slipstreaming can save time and money.  It is possible to add [[service pack]]s and other updates and patches to the install source, as well as extra drivers.  In a Windows environment, slipstreaming all needed drivers onto the install source will save time downloading them from the Internet. However, if newer drivers are available then a new install source would be needed.  It also involves more work initially, but can save time later on in reinstallation terms. This is especially significant for administrators that have to manage a large number of computers, where the default case for installing an operating system on each computer would be to use the original media and then update each computer after the installation was complete, as opposed to using a more up-to-date (slipstreamed) source, and having to download/install a minimal number of updates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adding patches to the install source is also another time saver. However, not all (Windows) patches can be applied in this fashion and one disadvantage is that if it is discovered that a certain patch is responsible for later problems, said patch cannot be removed without using an original, non-slipstreamed install CD.  Online instructions for this way of doing things emphasise the use of virtual PC environments (such as &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[VMWare &lt;/span&gt;Workstation]] or [[VirtualBox]]) for testing, as the end user often gets no support from the program manufacturer for using these &quot;homemade&quot; CDs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
