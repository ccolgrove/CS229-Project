  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like the other BSD kernels (and those of most modern operating systems), DragonFly employs a built-in [[kernel debugger]] to help the developers find kernel bugs. Furthermore, as of Wednesday, [[October 20]], [[2004]], a debug kernel, which makes bug reports more useful for tracking down kernel-related problems, is installed by default, at the expense of a relatively small quantity of disk space. When a new kernel is installed, the backup copy of the previous kernel and its modules are stripped of their debugging symbols to further minimize disk space usage. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The operating system is distributed as a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[liveCD|live &lt;/span&gt;CD]] that boots into a complete DragonFly system. It includes the base system and a complete set of manual pages, and may include source code and useful packages in future versions. The advantage of this is that with a single CD you can install the software onto a computer, use a full set of tools to repair a damaged installation, or demonstrate the capabilities of the system without installing it. Daily snapshots are available from Simon 'corecode' Schubert via [ftp://chlamydia.fs.ei.tum.de/pub/DragonFly/snapshots/i386/ISO-IMAGES/ FTP] and [http://chlamydia.fs.ei.tum.de/pub/DragonFly/snapshots/i386/ISO-IMAGES/ HTTP] for those who want to install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
