  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Remaster''' (and its derivations, frequently found in the phrases '''digitally remastered''' or '''digital remastering''') is a word marketed mostly in the digital audio age, although the remastering process has existed since recording began. The measure of its success depends on: 1. The skill and experience of the [[Mastering Engineer]] staff. 2. The equipment used for the process. 3. The quality of the original source recordings. Frequently advertised with regard to [[CD]] and [[DVD]] releases, remastering has become a powerful [[buzzword]] in multimedia industries, and it generally implies quality enhancement of sound and/or picture to a previously existing recording (frequently designed to encourage people to buy a new version of something they already own). For example, the [[reissue]] boom that began in the mid-nineties saw remastered versions of the back-catalogues of [[The Who]], [[The Byrds]] and others, while remastered editions of first-generation DVD releases are similarly bestsellers. Despite its status as an industry buzzword, however, remastering actually refers to a fairly distinct process, one that does not inherently include the notion of a positive or neutral upgrade.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
