  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some say that the development team needs someone who understands foreign languages and cultures and has a technical background and such a person may be difficult to find. Others argue that the commercial case to localise products into multiple languages is very obvious, and that all is needed is a budgetary commitment from the producer to finance the considerable costs. It costs more to produce products for international markets, but in an increasingly global economy, English only is scarcely an option. For instance, if a message displayed to the user in one of several languages is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed. [[Software library|Software libraries]] that aid this task are available, such as [[gettext]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
