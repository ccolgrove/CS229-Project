  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was found that the emission of only 90 photons was required in order to elicit visual experience. However, only 45 of these actually entered the retina, due to absorption by the [[optic media]]. Furthermore, 80% of these did not reach the fovea. Therefore, it only takes nine photons to be detected by the human eye.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Moreover, as the chance of any one rod receiving more than one photon is very small, we can assume that it only takes one photon to excite a rod receptor.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}.  Threshold cannot be determined on perfect sensation or lack thereof, due to fluctuations in the threshold. Thus, there is no set brightness seen by the viewer, and no intensity just lower than this that no flash is seen.  To activate a bipolar, multiple rods must be stimulated, e.g., as 1940âs experiments have determined, that eleven quanta, one for each single rod, is necessary to trigger light perception.  Another experiment shows that a 60 percent frequency may represent 2,500 quanta, one per rod, among a patch of 2 million rods.  Therefore only one rod out of many is perceived at the threshold, and in a short stimulus, rods cannot absorb more than a single photon of light.
