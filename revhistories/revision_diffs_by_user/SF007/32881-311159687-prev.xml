  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the mid-1990s, the average [[Internet]] user was still on [[dial-up]], with average speed ranging between 28.8 and 33.6 [[Kilobit per second|kbit/s]]. If one wished to download a piece of software, which could run about 200 [[Megabyte|MB]], the download time could be longer than one day, depending on network traffic, the [[Internet Service Provider]], and the server. Around 1997, [[broadband]] began to gain popularity due to its greatly increased network speeds. As &quot;large-sized file transfer&quot; problems became less severe, warez became more widespread and began to affect large [[software]] files like [[animation]]s and [[Film|movie]]s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the past, files were distributed by [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] technology: with a central uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, a large number of downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for [[peer-to-peer]] networking; the ''more'' downloaders the ''faster'' the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in [[file sharing]] systems like [[eDonkey2000]] or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities.  There are many sites with links to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Rapidshare]] &lt;/span&gt;and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
