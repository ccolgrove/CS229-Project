  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first Compact Disc drives on personal computers were generally much too slow for running complex operating systems such as Linux. Often, the computer could not even boot from [[optical disc]]s.  When operating systems were distributed on discs, either a [[boot floppy]] or the CD itself would boot specifically, and only, in order to install onto a hard drive.  There was little reason not to install directly on a hard disk. However, in the case of Linux, the free operating system was meeting resistance in the consumer market because of the difficulty and effort and risk involved with installing an additional partition on the hard disk, particularly the ext2 filesystem. The term &quot;Live CD&quot; was coined because after typical PC RAM was large enough and 52X speed CD drives and CD burners were widespread among PC owners, it finally became convenient and practical to boot the kernel, run X11, a window manager and GUI applications directly from a CD without disturbing the OS (generally Windows on FAT32 or NTFS) on the hard disk. This was a new and different situation for Linux than other OSes, because the updates/upgrades were being released so quickly, different distributions and versions were being offered online, and especially because users were burning their own CDs. Copying Linux from the installation media was also encouraged instead of actively hindered and discouraged with such things as requiring the input of long and elaborate serial numbers and lengthy and complicated installation procedures. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first [[Linux]]-based LiveCD was [[Yggdrasil Linux]] (went out of production in [[1995]]), though in practice it did not function well due to the low throughput of then-current CD-ROM drives. The [[Debian]]-derived Linux distribution  [[Knoppix]] was released in [[2003]], and found popularity as both a [[data recovery|rescue disk]] system and as a primary distribution in its own right. Since 2003, the popularity of LiveCDs has increased substantially, partly due to [http://www.linux-live.org/ Linux Live &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;scripts], &lt;/span&gt;and [[remastersys]] which made it very easy to build customized live systems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
