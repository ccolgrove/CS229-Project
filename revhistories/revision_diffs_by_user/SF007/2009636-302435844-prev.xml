  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;FOSS methods, on the other hand, typically don't limit the use of software in this fashion. Instead, the revenue model is based mainly on support services. [[Canonical Ltd.]] is one such company that gives its software away freely, but charges for support services.  The [[source code]] of the software is usually given away, and pre-compiled binary software frequently accompanies it for convenience.  As a result, the source code can be freely modified.  However, there can be some license-based restrictions on re-distributing the software. Generally, software can be modified and re-distributed for free, as long as credit is given to the original manufacturer of the software. In addition, FOSS can generally be sold commercially, as long as the source-code is provided. There are a wide variety of [[free software license]]s that define how a program can be used, modified, and sold commercially (see [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], and [[BSD licenses|BSD-type licenses]]). FOSS may also be funded through donations. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] (publisher of [[Wikipedia]]) is one such organization (although they are also partially funded through grants, sponsorships, and brand merchandising).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
