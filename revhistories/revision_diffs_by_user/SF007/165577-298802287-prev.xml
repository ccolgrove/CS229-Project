  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Closed source''' is a term for software whose [[software license|license]] does not allow for the release or distribution of the software's source code.  Generally, it means only the [[binary file|binaries]] of a [[computer program]] are distributed and the license provides no access to the program's [[source code]].  The ''source code'' of such programs might be regarded as a [[trade secret]] of the company. Access to source code by third parties commonly requires the party to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The phrase &quot;closed source&quot;, in relation to the open source definition, is ambiguous because it implies licensing where the source code to a program is unavailable.   However, if taken as being an antonym to [[open source]], it refers to software that does not meet the [[Open Source Definition]], which is a subtly different meaning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Microsoft's [[Shared source]] is an example of licensing where the source code is made available but not under an [[open-source license]].  If ''Closed source'' is interpreted as referring to software that does not meet the Open Source Definition, then ''Shared source'' is an example of ''Closed source'' licensing.  However, if it is interpreted as simply referring to programs where the source code is not available; this isn't the case.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
