  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In August 2005, a distribution [[Live CD]] based on Linspire's source pools named ''Freespire'' hit the web by accident.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wiki.freespire.org/index.php/FAQ_Category:_About_Freespire_and_The_Freespire_Project#Wasn.27t_there_a_Freespire_project_released_towards_the_end_of_2005.3F_Is_this_the_same_project.3F | title = Wasn't there a Freespire project released towards the end of 2005?

Freespire was confused by some users to be an actual product from Linspire, and at the request of Linspire the distribution adopted a development codename ''Squiggle''&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.squiggleos.org/ | title = Squiggle OS website | accessdate = 2006-04-27 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and began looking for a new name. Linspire then, on the back of the generated publicity, offered users a &quot;free Linspire&quot; (purchase price discounted to $0) by using the coupon code &quot;Freespire&quot; until [[September 9]], [[2005]]. Squiggle OS is no longer in active development.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
