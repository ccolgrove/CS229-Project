The moral ambiguity of the show is best shown in the fact that Mac, although a friend of Veronica's, is the person who created the test in the first place, thus making it possible for the &quot;sex crazed 09ers&quot; to access other people's purity tests - and thus is also responsible for the chaos which is the focus of this episode.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
