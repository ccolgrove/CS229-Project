  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As early as Mac OS X v10.5 build 9A466 the community has maintained a version of Leopard which can run on non-Apple hardware.  A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created one of the earliest patching processes which made it convenient for users to install Mac OS X onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple Mac OS X.  It was utilizing the BrazilMac patch that many effortless distros of Mac OSx86 came to fruition.  Four of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;iATKOS, &lt;/span&gt;and [[iDeneb]] - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity.  However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the internet. There continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever increasing number of third party components.  The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel Patcher was created which removed the [[HPET]] requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On January 2, 2009, InsanelyMac's Live DVD team published a new method by which a Mac OS X v10.5.x [[Live DVD]] could be produced, allowing users to boot a fully working OS X desktop from a DVD or USB flash drive. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=144128&amp;amp;st=0h 2009 Live DVD, howto make a simple, working osx livedvd]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The method was more reliable than previous methods, as it manipulated Apple's existing Netboot and Imageboot functionalities, and behaved as if the system was running off a network disk. It was also easier to produce, requiring only a single script be added to an existing installation, and a distribution of the live DVD has been made since. It is notable that this method has been shown to work on normal Apple Mac hardware since.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
