  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hybrid-CD also refers to [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CD]] which also includes a [[ISO 9660|data track]] storing [[MP3]] (or other digital audio compression format) copy of those [[Red Book (CD standard)|CDDA]] tracks.  Before the introduction and subsequent popularization of [[iTunes]] and the [[iPod]], such discs were popular for sharing music on [[compact disc]] without requiring the recipient to extract and encode the CDDA themselves â a technical and perhaps time-consuming process on older computing hardware.  However, with the advent of faster computing hardware and vastly simplified automated extraction and encoding tools (e.g. iTunes, [[Rhythmbox]], etc.) and the lack of an automated hybrid feature in that very same software, popularity of such hybrid CD has subsequently declined.  Furthermore, the legal status of such discs poses [[Efficiency (economics)|economic frictions]] in that they may be interpreted as two copies of a [[copyright]]ed work.  However, such hybrid discs do remain in a commercial setting as a [[digital rights management]] enforcement technique, where encrypted compressed copies of the digital audio are provided with [[proprietary software]] for listening in a computer disc drive, while the CDDA is included for playback in stand-alone CD players.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
