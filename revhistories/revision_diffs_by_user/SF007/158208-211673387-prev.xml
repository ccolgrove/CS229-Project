  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Afrikakorps was formed upon the arrival on [[February 12]], [[1941]], of General [[Erwin Rommel]] after the German Armed Forces High Command or [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (''OKW'') and Army High Command or [[Oberkommando des Heeres]] (''OKH'') had decided to send a &quot;blocking force&quot; to [[Libya]] to support the Italian army, which had been routed by a Commonwealth Force's counter-offensive led by the British Eighth Army, in [[Operation Compass|Operation ''Compass'']]. The German &quot;blocking force&quot;, commanded by Rommel, at first consisted of only the 5./leichte &quot;Afrika&quot; [[Panzer]] [[Regiment]] which was quickly cobbled together from the second regiment of the 3./Panzer Division and various other small units attached for water treatment and medical care. These elements were organized into the [[German 5th Light Division|5th Light Division]] when they arrived in Africa from February 10âMarch 12, 1941. In late April and into May the 5th Light Division was joined by transference of the various elements constituting the [[German 15th Panzer Division|15th Panzer Division]] from Italy, though it did not completely arrive until after Rommel had made a counter-offensive and re-taken most of [[Cyrenaica]] and then subsequently gone back over to the defensive. At this time the Afrikakorps consisted of the two divisions plus various smaller supporting units, and was officially subordinated to the Italian chain of command in Africa (though Rommel had conducted his offensive without any authorization).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
