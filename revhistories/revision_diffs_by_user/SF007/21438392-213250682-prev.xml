He is [[Tintin and Snowy|Tintin's]] best friend, a seafaring captain in the [[Merchant Navy]] or [[Merchant Marine]]. Haddock was initially depicted as a weak and [[alcoholic]] character, but in later albums he became more respectable and genuinely heroic (notably in the pivotal ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', in which he stoically volunteers his life to save his friend). Although when introduced Haddock has command of a freighter, in later volumes he is clearly [[retired]]. The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm acts as a counterpoint to Tintin's often implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter gets too [[idealistic]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
