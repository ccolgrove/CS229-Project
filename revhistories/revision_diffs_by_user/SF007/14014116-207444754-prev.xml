  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;gOS is based on the [[Ubuntu &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] &lt;/span&gt;7.10 distribution and a GUI largely imitative of [[Mac OS X Leopard]]. The earlier versions (1 and 2-beta) used the [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] 17 window manager instead of the usual [[GNOME]] or [[KDE]] desktops, to create a desktop that had similar usability to [[Mac OS X]]. This was possible because of the flexibility of Enlightenment. Enlightenment acts both as an [[X window manager]], and as a [[desktop environment]]. Therefore early versions gOS worked on systems as low end as a 350&amp;amp;nbsp;MHz Pentium II with 196 MB of RAM.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; 196 MB was needed to install gOS through the Live CD, but it ran on as little RAM as 128MB when installed, or when running from the Live CD&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; But a typical gOS system would have used as a minimum a 1&amp;amp;nbsp;GHz [[Pentium III]] with 256 MB RAM. After gOS2-beta the later versions of gOS abandoned the use as Enlightenment as desktop manager (although some E17 code still seems to be used), in favour of using Gnome, with Compiz fusion and the [[Avant Window Navigator]]. This increased the need for memory to values similar to normal Ubuntu.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Based on the idea of [[cloud computing]], all versions of gOS lean heavily on on-line applications built on Web 2.0 and [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] technology so they also do not use much hard disk space for applications. The whole gOS-1 system fitted comfortably in less than 2 GB. Also many of the documents created with gOS, such as [[Google Docs]] documents, can be saved on Google servers instead of on the local hard disk, so gOS can work with very small hard disks. In gOS V2 Rocket, Good OS introduced the use of Google's &quot;[[Google Gears]]&quot; technology which promises to make Google's [[web application]]s usable without an internet connection. [http://www.linuxelectrons.com/news/linux/15642/linux-based-gos-2-0-will-debut-monday]. Currently, [[Google Reader]] is the only Google application that is supported, though other web applications such as [[Remember the Milk]] have added Google Gears functionality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The MyMiniPC targeted MySpace users with it's glossy white case, 3D desktop, and a media center dock stacked with MySpace and Web 2.0 folders for News, Photos, Videos, Music, TV and Movies, and more. All in a system  one and half inches tall and weighing two pounds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;gOS 2.9 Space is however also a generic Linux distribution, and is a debugged and extended version of the older gOS V2 Rocket. It can be downloaded as an .ISO [http://dev.thinkgos.com/downloads] that can be burned on a DVD (it's slightly too large for a CD), or can be put on another external boot-able medium like a [[memory stick]], or a [[Secure Digital card]] reader acting as an external USB drive, with enough capacity. The DVD will also soon be sold from The Good OS store on their web-site [http://dev.thinkgos.com/store]. gOS space is loaded with new  MySpace features, but all the old Google applications can still be used too.  As a Linux distro 2.9 is much more complete than 2.0-beta, and less buggy. gOS Space is less &quot;light&quot; (using a small amount of memory) than older publicly available versions, as its based on a combination of [[Ubuntu &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] &lt;/span&gt;7.10 the [[Gnome]] windows manager enhanced with [[Compiz fusion]] and the [[Avant Window Navigator]], a [[Dock (computing)|Dock]] like launcher, that has been enhanced with [[Stacks (software)|Stacks]]. According to Good OS there is also [[Enlightenment (window manager)]] code used, but it's still unknown for what.  In any case gOS Space needs about 384MB of RAM to work reasonably, the same amount as straight Ubuntu 7.10.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
