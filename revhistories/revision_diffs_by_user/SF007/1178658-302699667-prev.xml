  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Linux &lt;/span&gt;advocates such as [[Linus Torvalds]] and [[Richard Stallman]] have criticised OpenSolaris as an attempt to draw developers away from Linux and get them hooked into a proprietary OS. Common arguments against OpenSolaris in the Linux community are that OpenSolaris is released under a different license than the one used by Linux. Sun has released a lot of software under the same GPL that Linux is released under but Linux advocates say that it is not good enough if all software is not GPLed. Linux users see OpenSolaris as nothing more than a &quot;Linux Copying Thing&quot; and as an attack on Linux from a big corporate monster, Sun Microsystems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sun has repeatedly said that OpenSolaris does not attempt to copy Linux, and that far from being an attack on Linux, OpenSolaris is good for Linux.  OpenSolaris is a valid competitor with Linux, and that will drive improvements in Linux.  OpenSolaris is open source and as such Linux and OpenSolaris can learn from each other.  The Linux community should be happy for every new piece of software that is open sourced, under any license, and not complain that it is not enough or that it is an attack on Linux.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
