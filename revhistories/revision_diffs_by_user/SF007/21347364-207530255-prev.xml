  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]] announced the [[GNU]] project, an ambitious effort to create a [[free software]] [[Unix-like]] system; &quot;free&quot; in that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, [[GNU Hurd]], had not produced a working kernel, but the [[Linux kernel]] was released as free software in 1992 under the [[GNU General Public License]]. In addition to their use in the [[Linux]] operating system, many GNU packages â such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (and the rest of the [[GNU toolchain]]), the [[glibc|GNU C library]] and the [[Coreutils|GNU core utilities]] â have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

BSDi]]), it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix â for free, if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different directions, including [[OpenBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
