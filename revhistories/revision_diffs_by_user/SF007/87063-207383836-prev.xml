  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to [[video games]] with people often developing an obsessive loyalty towards one console platform.  This may be due in part to the price of the consoles limiting many to a choice of one console, with the obsession possibly stemming from defence of that decision.  The term is also applied increasingly to enthusiasts of computer platforms such as &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[OS X]], [[Windows]] &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Linux]], &lt;/span&gt;although the term is also applied to fans of certain [[television]] programmes. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as &quot;fanboys.&quot; Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in [[comic book]] circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
