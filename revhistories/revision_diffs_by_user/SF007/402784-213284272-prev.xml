Many critics felt Serkis should have been nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance since the movie used his voice, body language, and facial expressions. There is the argument that some of his CGI actions were partially, or in some cases fully animated, without his own movements, but the same can be said for actors in a traditional movie involving CGI. Some believed incorrectly that the Academy ruled that he did not qualify because he never physically appeared onscreen. There is no such prohibition, and in fact Serkis appeared onscreen as [[SmÃ©agol]] before he became Gollum in the third film. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
