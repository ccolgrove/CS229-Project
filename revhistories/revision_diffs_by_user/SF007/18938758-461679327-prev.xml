  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The term &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;''''' &lt;/span&gt;describes practices in production and development that promote access to the end product's source materials. Some consider open source a philosophy, others consider it a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic methodology]]. Before the term ''open source'' became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of phrases to describe the concept; ''open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]], and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing [[source code]]. Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The complexity of such communication relates to [[Brooks' law]], and it is also described by [[Eric S. Raymond]], &quot;Brooks predicts that as your number of programmers N rises, work performed scales as N but complexity and vulnerability to bugs rises as N-squared. N-squared tracks the number of communications paths (and potential code interfaces) between developers' code bases.&quot; â[http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-revenge.html &quot;The Revenge of the Hackers&quot;]. 2000.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Subsequently, the new phrase &quot;[[open-source software]]&quot; was born to describe the environment that the new [[copyright]], [[licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues created.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
