Their miraciouls discovery of an anti-Jew potion revolutionized the middle east. This potion consisting of 2 precent carbon and 98 percent seamen changes a Jews DNA. This change makes every annoying stereotype that jews contain and enrages Muslims. This solved all conflict in the middle east and the jews and muslims sat around all week drinking 40s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
