  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] ratio of one thousand.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black. The light level that is interpreted as &quot;black&quot; can be shifted across six orders of magnitudeâa factor of one million.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect.  This means that area of stimulation varies inversely with the intensity, a strong stimulus over 100 rods or less is equivalent to one that is weak and over 1,000 rods. In sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot; ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''. 2008. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;EncyclopÃ¦dia &lt;/span&gt;Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;DVD.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fovea is blind to dim light (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night must be viewed from the side, so it stimulates the rods. This is not due to pupil width since an artificial fixed-width pupil gives the same results.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
