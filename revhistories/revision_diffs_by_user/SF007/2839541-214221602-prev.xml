The country is known for its [[bilingual]] [[community]] and problems thereabout. On page 21 Beefix and Brawnix quarrel about an ox tongue. Beefix's wife ends their discussion and says to Asterix: &quot;Il y a toujours un problÃ¨me de langue entre ces deux castars lÃ  !...&quot; (&quot;There's always a language problem between those two.&quot;- &quot;une langue&quot; means &quot;a tongue&quot;, but also &quot;language&quot; in French)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
