  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[computing]], '''booting''' (also known as '''booting up''') is a process that starts [[operating system]]s when the user turns on a [[computer system]]. A '''boot sequence''' is the initial set of operations that the computer performs when power is switched on. The '''boot loader''' typically loads the main operating system for the computer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beginning with the [[IBM 701]] in the 1950s to the present, booting has been used to load operating systems into the main [[computer memory|memory]] of [[mainframe computer]]s, [[minicomputers]], and [[personal computer]]s.  [[Plug and play]] systems, such as video games and computer printers, are an exception to this rule because they execute directly from [[read-only memory]] (ROM).  There are numerous examples of single and multi-stage booting beginning with the execution of boot program(s) stored in [[BIOS]] or boot ROMs.  During the booting process, the [[binary code]] of the operating system is loaded from non-volatile secondary storage (such as a [[hard disk drive]]) into volatile, or [[random-access memory]] &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;memory &lt;/span&gt;(RAM) and then executed.  The booting concept is also known as &quot;Initial Program Load&quot; for [[IBM]] mainframe computers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The computer word ''boot'' is short for [[bootstrapping|''bootstrap'']] (itself short for ''bootstrap load''). The term ''bootstrap'' derives from the idiom ''to  [[Bootstrapping#Straps on leather boots|pull oneself up by one's bootstraps]]''. The term refers to the problem whereby a computer cannot run without first loading software but must be running before any software can be loaded.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/290800.html |title=Phrase Finder |publisher=phrases.org.uk}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
