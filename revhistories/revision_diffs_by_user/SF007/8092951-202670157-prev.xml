  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some applications, in order to work properly with wine, require more tweaking than simply installing the application, such as manually configuring Wine to use certain Windows DLLs. The Wine project does not integrate such workarounds into the Wine codebase, instead preferring to focus solely on improving Wine's implementation of the Windows API. While this approach focuses Wine development on long-term compatibility, it makes it difficult for users to run applications which can run using workarounds. Consequently, many third party applications have been created to ease the use of these applications which don't work &quot;out of the box&quot; within Wine itself, Wine-doors is one of them.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
