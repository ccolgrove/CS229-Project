  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The original purpose for the self-extracting archive was to allow the distribution of tools for extracting (and adding) member files to an archive file.  The situation otherwise, in effect, represents a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem: in order to use an archive file, the user requires a de-archiver program, which they have to be able to get onto their computer.  If the de-archiver program was simply a single executable with no other files, it would be possible to simply download that one file, then execute it.  But if the means to unarchive files required, say, an executable program and several libraries, there would be no way to obtain them as a single download or executable which could be installed unless the unarchiver program itself (along with accompanying files) were a self-extracting archive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Several programs make use of self-extracting archives. For [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] there is [[WinZip]], [[WinRAR]], [[7-Zip]], and the built-in [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb496379.aspx IExpress Wizard]. For [[Macintosh]] there is [[StuffIt]], [[The Unarchiver]], and [[7zX]]. There are also programs (like &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[http://www.megastep.org/makeself/ makeself]) &lt;/span&gt;that create self-extracting archives on [[Unix]] as [[shell scripts]]. An early example of a self-extracting archive was the Unix [[shar]] archive, in which one or more text files were combined into a shell script that when executed recreated the original files.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Distributing and receiving files which appear to be self-extracting archives can be dangerous, as the file itself may contain malicious code, like [[computer virus|viruses]] or [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]. Fortunately, many archivers are capable of working with self-extracting archives as if they were regular archives. For instance, in self-extracting archive  of Winzip, you can click Run Winzip to view the archive. However, if you do this, it would require Winzip to be installed on your machine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
