  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Blindwrite''', the successor to Blindread, is a computer program that writes to recordable CDs. The Blindread software, which reads CDs and writes [[CD image]] files, has been discontinued as a separately released product, but Blindread's code is included in the newer Blindwrite suite of software that also code to control [[CD writer]]s. Blindwrite's most distinctive feature touted over other pre-existing CD writing software was to use the CD images Blindread made. Blindread's main features were the use of Sub codes and its willingness to be &quot;blind&quot; to errors and continue the copying process, rather than quitting when encountering reading errors often caused from hardware trouble or disk damage (such as scratches or even intentional &quot;damage&quot; created by the manufacturer as a form of copy protection) that would often cause many other software packages to terminate the reading process.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
