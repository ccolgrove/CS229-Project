The &quot;guest&quot; OS environments share the same OS as the host system &amp;amp;ndash; i.e. the same OS kernel is used to implement the &quot;guest&quot; environments. Applications running in a given &quot;guest&quot; environment view it as a stand-alone system. Examples are [[Linux-VServer]], [[Virtuozzo]] (for Windows or Linux), [[OpenVZ]], [[Solaris Containers]], and [[FreeBSD Jail]]s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;; [[Application Virtualization]]: Using a software virtualization layer to encapsulate a [[desktop]] or [[Server (computing)|server]] application from the local operating system.  The application still executes locally using local resources, but without being [[software installation|installed]] in the traditional sense&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;SoftgridIntro&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/enterprise/softgrid.mspx|title=Introducing Microsoft SoftGrid Application Virtualization|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. Application resources and components such as files and settings are typically stored a single package that is interpreted by the virtualization layer, and presented to the application as if they were installed on the local operating system where the application expects them.  This is in contrast with running the application as conventional local software (i.e. software that has been 'installed' on the system so that its files and configuration settings actually reside locally). Since the virtual environment acts as a layer between the application and the operating system, it is able to intercept and address application conflicts and application-OS conflicts. Examples include the Sun [[Java Virtual Machine]], [[Microsoft Application Virtualization]], [[VMware ThinApp]] (formely Thinstall), [[Altiris]], and  [[Trigence]]. (This approach to virtualization is clearly different from the preceding ones; only an arbitrary line separates it from such virtual machine environments as [[Smalltalk]], [[Forth (programming language)|FORTH]], [[Tcl]], [[P-code]], or any [[interpreted language]].)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
