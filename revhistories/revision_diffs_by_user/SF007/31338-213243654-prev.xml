  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The settings within ''Tintin'' have also added depth to the strips. HergÃ© mingles real and fictional lands into his stories, along with a base in [[Belgium]] from where the heroes set off. This is originally 26 Labrador Road, but later [[Marlinspike Hall]]. This is best demonstrated in ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'', in which HergÃ© creates two fictional countries ([[Syldavia]] and [[Borduria]]) and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson250&quot;/&amp;gt; Other fictional lands include [[San Theodoros]], [[San Paolo]] and Nuevo Rico in South America, the kingdom or [[administrative region]] of Gaipajama in India and Khemed in the Middle East. Along with these fictitious locations, actual nations were employed such as Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, England, Soviet Union, United States, Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Sahara Desert, Indonesia, Tibet, China and Japan. Another setting was the [[Moon]], and in the first edition of ''Land of Black Gold'', [[Palestine]], though this was later replaced by the fictional Khemed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
