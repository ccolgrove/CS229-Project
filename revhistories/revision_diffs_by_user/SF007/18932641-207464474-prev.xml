  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2007, English software developer Patrick Robin reported that the MPAA was illegally using his blogging platform, [[Forest Blog]]. Forest Blog is distributed for free under a [[linkware]] license; anyone who uses it must link back to his site where Forest Blog is offered for download. To remove the links back to his site, they must purchase a license. The MPAA had removed the links, without paying for a license.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On November 23, 2007, Matthew Garret notified the MPAA that it was in violation of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) for distributing a software toolkit designed to help universities detect instances of potentially illegal file-sharing on school networks. This tool kit was based on the [[Ubuntu &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] &lt;/span&gt;version of the [[Linux]] operating system, which is licensed under the GPL.  The violation was distributing a derived work without making the source code available.  On December 1, 2007, Mr. Garrett notified the [[Internet service provider]] for the MPAA that, in accordance with the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], he was requesting them to disable the offending distribution web site.  It is not clear if this request was ever honored. However, the MPAA did change the site so as not to offer the toolkit for distribution.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
