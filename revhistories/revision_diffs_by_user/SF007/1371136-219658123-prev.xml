Together, they leave ValadilÃ¨ne. As Oscar seems to know where he is going with his train, Kate sits and enjoys the ride.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Oscar tells Kate that the locomotiveâs spring is totally unwound and that the train can not go further. After a quick walk along the tracks, Kate finds a mechanism to wind up the train at some distance in front of the station (apparently, Hans went through this place), but there is no way to pull the train from the station to the mechanism. Luckily, there is a canal running alongside the tracks, and in the aviary-station, an old couple is waiting on a tugboat. They are willing to help Kate to tow the train, but want to be paid $100, which Kate does not have. She decides to leave the station and goes into the university to see if someone could help her by lending some money. Inside, she meets Professor Pons, a specialist of paleontology, from whom she learns that Hans stayed at the university a long time ago and came to his class. Apparently, Hans was passionate by Ponsâs teachings about the mysterious prehistoric Youkol people which lived with mammoths and were able to domesticate them. Unfortunately for Kate, Hans has left Barrockstadt a long time ago, to find the Youkol and mammoths, for he was sure they survived somewhere. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kate also speaks with the universityâs board of directors, which is a rather frustrating &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;experience. They agree to give Kate some money, if she is able to fix one of Hansâs creations on the campus: a [[bandstand]]-automaton. As Kate is becoming acquainted with Hansâs mechanical pieces of art, this is not a difficult task for her, and she even discovers a little traffic going on in the university while trying to fix the broken bandstand. With the $100 reward, she pays the mariners and helps them to go pass the locks. In return, they tow the train out of the station to the wind-up mechanism. After convincing the guard of the city to open the door protecting it against an invasion, the quest to find Hans Voralberg continues, and the train rushes up North.  While its location is never explicitly stated, from its name, appearance and character Barrockstadt seems Germanic, its dividing wall reminiscent of the division between the former [[BRD]] and [[German Democratic Republic|DDR]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
