  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems, treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s, [[computer terminal|terminal]]s, or [[disk drive]]s), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as [[ioctl]] and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple &quot;stream of bytes&quot; model. The [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's [[RSX-11]]M's &quot;group, user&quot; hierarchy evolved into [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] directories, [[CP/M]]'s volumes evolved into [[MS-DOS]] 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's [[Multi-Programming Executive|MPE]] group.account hierarchy and IBM's [[System Support Program|SSP]] and [[OS/400]] library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
