The device OS is unknown, and not user accessible for development or customization. There were initial unconfirmed reports stating the device OS is [[VxWorks]]. However, it has recently come to light that [http://www.laser5.co.jp Laser5], a Japanese open source embedded software development house, was involved in Linux driver development for the Wizpy. It is unknown if this was for a driver on the host PC OS for accessing the Wizpy, or for internal drivers on board the device OS. If the latter, it would imply that the device OS is also Linux. However, there currently does not seem to be any announcements regarding this. If the device OS is Linux, and the source code has not been released, this may qualify as a GPL violation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
