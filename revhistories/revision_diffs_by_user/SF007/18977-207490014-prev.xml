  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;MINIX 3 was publicly announced on [[24 October]] [[2005]] by Andrew Tanenbaum during his keynote speech on top of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Symposium Operating Systems Principles conference.  Although it still serves as an example for the new edition of Tanenbaum and Woodhull's textbook, it is comprehensively redesigned to be &quot;usable as a serious system on resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability.&quot; MINIX 3 currently supports only [[IA-32]] architecture PC compatible systems. It is available in a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[LiveCD]] &lt;/span&gt;format that allows it to be used on a computer without installing it on the hard drive, and in versions compatible with hardware emulation/virtualization systems, including [[Bochs]], [[Qemu]], [[VMware Workstation]]/[[VMware Fusion|Fusion]], and [[Microsoft Virtual PC]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Version 3.1.2 was released [[8 May]] [[2006]]. It contains [[X11]], [[emacs]], [[vi]], cc, [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], [[perl]], [[Python (programming language)|python]], [[Almquist shell|ash]], [[bash]], [[zsh]], [[ftp]], [[Secure Shell|ssh]], [[telnet]], [[Pine (e-mail client)|pine]], and over 400 other common [[UNIX]] utility programs. With the addition of X11, this version marks the transition away from a text-only system.  Another feature of this version, which will be improved in future ones, is the ability of the system to withstand device driver crashes, and in many cases having them automatically replaced without affecting running processes. In this way, MINIX is [[self-healing]] and can be used in applications demanding high reliability.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
