  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sun's goal is to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed-source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source. A third party project called [[IcedTea]] has been started that creates a completely free and highly usable JDK by replacing encumbered code with either stubs or code from [[GNU Classpath]]. [[IcedTea]] is already available on [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora 7]] and [[Ubuntu &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
