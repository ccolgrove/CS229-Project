  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another criticism of the Open Source movement is that these projects may not be really as self-organizing as their proponents claim. This argument holds that successful Open Source projects frequently have a strong central manager, even if that manager is a volunteer. The article [http://www.chc-3.com/pub/manage_themselves.htm Open Source Projects Manage Themselves? Dream On.] by Chuck Connell explains this viewpoint. However this is a criticism of the development model, not of the Open Source itself. Also, the author does not state that self organization surely does not work, just points to the cases when the central management was likely involved.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
