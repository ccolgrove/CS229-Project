  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to the legend the placeâs name is due to a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[fig]] &lt;/span&gt;tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. The historian Nelson Borges said, however, that Figueira comes from the word &quot;fagaria&quot;, which means &quot;opening, huge mouth&quot;. Foz comes from the Latin word &quot;fouces&quot; = &quot;mouth of a river&quot;, and Mondego comes from the pre-romanic expressions &quot;mond&quot; = &quot;mouth&quot; and &quot;aec&quot;= &quot;river&quot;. That means, Figueira da Foz would be &quot;the riverâs mouth opening&quot;. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the [[neolithic]] age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. JuliÃ£o, to the cathedral [[SÃ© Velha of Coimbra]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Knowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role for the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the [[shipbuilding]] industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to ''vila'' (small town) on March 12th, 1771 and turned city (''cidade'') on September 20th, 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained great reputation in the 1920's and 1930's. The city had the Potuguese nickname of ''Rainha das Praias'' (Queen of the Beaches).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
