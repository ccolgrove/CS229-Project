  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alco Gravure was originally the printing division of Crowll Collier, which published This Week Magazine. Sometime in the 1960's, the magazine folded, and McMillan, Inc. purchased the company, calling it Crowell Collier Macmillan, and later Macmillan Publishing. Alco had five plants: Hoboken, NJ, Glen Burnie (Baltimore), MD, Homewood (Memphis), TN, Chicago, IL, and North Hollywood, CA. Their business was split between two markets, Sunday magazines for major newspapers and mail pieces and newspaper inserts for major retailers. Customers included Sears, Walgreens, Montgomery Wards, W.T. Grant, Macy's, The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Star, Philadelphia Bulletin and Los Angeles Times. It operated as a commercial gravure printer under Macmillan's ownership until 1981&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
