  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Libranet attempted to carve a niche in the Linux distro market as the user-friendly distro, with extensive support (termed &quot;up and running support&quot;), that, of all the desktop distros, was the most compatible with the actual Debian release (at this time, Woody).  The support offered was truly extensive, where Jon Danzig, the founder of Libranet, would often personally answer people's inquiries.  This helped make people who had chosen Libranet be even more loyal to this distribution.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Libranet released version 3.0, which received good reviews, but the market had changed for desktop distributions. Various other commercial vendors had released free versions of their distributions, such as [[SUSE]], which released [[OpenSUSE]], and [[Red Hat]], which released [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]].  Whereas Libranet sold their distribution, and then gave free extensive support, many distributors chose to give away their distribution and sell support, and/or sell proprietary software enhancements to the distribution.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
