  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Two programmers, working under the pseudonyms ''Mifki'' or ''Vitaliy'' and ''Semthex'' released new kernels by starting with the open source [[XNU]] tree and applying patches necessary to run the kernel on non-apple hardware. Mifki's goal was to release the kernel with as few patches as possible, able to run on close-to-Apple hardware. Semthex's goal was to make his kernel more compatible with legacy hardware with the omission of some crucial features. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Both kernels allowed most of the updated kernel extensions/frameworks to work, making properly configured [[beige-box PC]]s operate more like genuine Apple computers. While Mifki has only updated his kernel once, Semthex updates it regularly and added [[AMD]], &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[VMWare]] &lt;/span&gt;and SSE2-support in later versions. Semthex released his hacked kernel source code on his webpage. On December 24, 2006 he also released the latest patches for the SSE3 kernel as a diff file for his original source tree as a Christmas present to the community. Special attention should be given to the SSE2 emulation which Semthex developed together with Rufus. This emulation was the first fully complete emulation of all SSE3 instructions to be presented to the OSx86 community. The previous SSE2 emulation was incomplete, only emulating 3 of the available SSE3 instructions, and very inefficient compared to the new [[emulator]]. The new emulator enabled even SSE2 OSx86 users to run SSE3 based applications such as [[iTunes]] 7 and most 3D programs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

A few weeks later, a hacker calling themselves ''tubgirl'' released an AMD-SSE3 install DVD. With Semthex's successful completion of the SSE2 Kernel, JaS released an SSE2-SSE3 universal DVD and announced his retirement from hacking Mac OS X after seven successful DVD releases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
