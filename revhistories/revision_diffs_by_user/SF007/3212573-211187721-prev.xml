  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Humanos''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Humans]]) is the name of a musical band from [[Portugal]] formed in [[2004]]. The idea behind it was to bring to light some unedited songs by a great Portuguese artist, a singer-songwriter from the [[eighties|1980âs]], [[AntÃ³nio VariaÃ§Ãµes]]. [[David Fonseca]], &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Manuela Azevedo &lt;/span&gt;(the lead singer of another Portuguese music group, [[ClÃ£]]), [[CamanÃ©]] (one of the most famous Portuguese ''[[fado|fadistas]]''), SÃ©rgio Nascimento (a member of [[SÃ©rgio Godinho]]âs band), HÃ©lder GonÃ§alves (also from [[ClÃ£]]), Nuno Rafael and JoÃ£o Cardoso are the seven members of a group responsible for what would become a huge success, something unedited in the Portuguese music scene. The homonymous album scored impressive quintuple platinum, staying for weeks in #1. &quot;Muda de Vida&quot;, &quot;Maria Albertina&quot; and &quot;Rugas&quot; are just some of the group hits. All this culminated in three sold out concerts, two of them in Coliseu dos Recreios ([[Lisbon]]) and the other in [[Porto]]. There was also another memorable performance, in front of a crowd of 40,000 people, at the ''[[Festival do Sudoeste]]'' Portuguese summer music festival, in the year 2005. This is supposed to be a short period of time project, because the unedited Antonio VariaÃ§Ãµesâ songs were very few in number. Thus, it was released on November of 2006 on CD and DVD with the recorded Coliseumsâ live concerts, which marked the end of the Humanos project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
