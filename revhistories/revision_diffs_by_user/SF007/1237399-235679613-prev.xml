  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''cPanel''' ('''c'''ontrol '''Panel''') is a graphical [[web-based]] [[Control panel (Web hosting)|web-hosting control panel]], designed to simplify administration of [[website]]s. cPanel handles aspects of website administration in its interface.  The [[software]], which is [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and distributed by cPanel, Inc., is designed for use by commercial [[web hosting]] services, so the company does not offer a reduced-cost personal use license; however, owners of non-profit organizations such as educational institutions and charities can request a license at a free or reduced cost. Reduced prices are frequently available from dedicated-server companies, who install it along with the operating system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
