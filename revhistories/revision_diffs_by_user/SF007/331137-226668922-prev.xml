Typically, the LiveDistro is named after the bootable medium it is stored on, such as a [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]] (Live CD/DVD) or a [[USB flash drive]] ([[Live USB]]).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The term &quot;live&quot; derives from the fact that these &quot;distros&quot;, or software distributions, each contain a complete, functioning and operational operating system on the distribution medium.  A LiveDistro does not alter the operating system or files already installed on the computer hard drive unless instructed to do so. LiveDistros often include mechanisms and utilities for more permanent installation, including [[disk partitioning]] tools. The default option, however, is to allow the user to return the computer to its previous state when the LiveDistro is ejected and the computer is [[reboot]]ed. It is able to run without permanent installation by placing the files that typically would be stored on a hard drive into [[Random access memory|RAM]], typically in a [[RAM disk]].  However, this does cut down on the RAM available to applications, reducing performance somewhat. As of 2007, certain LiveDistros run a [[graphical user interface]] in as little as 32MB RAM.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
