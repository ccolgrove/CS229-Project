He joined Gentoo shortly after its conception, merging Gentoo's first port into the mainline Gentoo repository, paving the way for other [[Gentoo Linux]] ports by implementing amongst many other things the Gentoo architecture keywords and portage profiles. Working together with [[Daniel Robbins]], Pieter spearheaded the Gentoo architectures and platforms effort. He founded Gentoo for [[Mac OS X]], for which he received a scholarship by [[Apple Computer]]. In 2004 Pieter was invited to the [[OpenSolaris]] pilot program and assisted [[Sun Microsystems]] with building a development eco-system around the [[Solaris operating system]]. Pieter was nominated for the OpenSolaris Community Advisory Board and managed a team of developers to make Gentoo available on the Solaris operating system as well. Pieter is a co-author of the Gentoo [[Social Contract]] and a co-author of the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo handbook].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
