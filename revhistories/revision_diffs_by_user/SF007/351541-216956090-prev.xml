  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;By default, VNC is not a secure protocol. While [[password]]s are not sent in plain-text (as in [[telnet]]), [[brute force attack|brute-force cracking]] could prove successful if both the [[encryption]] key and encoded password are sniffed from a network. For this reason it is recommended that a password of at least 8 characters be used. On the other hand, there is also an 8-character limit on some versions of VNC; if a password is sent exceeding 8 characters, the excess characters are removed and the truncated string is compared to the password.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
