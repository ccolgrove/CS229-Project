  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Fantasio''' is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' comic strip. He was introduced in 1944 by [[JijÃ©]], who was then drawing Spirou's adventures. Fantasio is Spirou's best friend and co-adventurer, a graphic reporter with an uncontrolled imagination and a mop of blond hair. In his early incarnation, he was considerably taller than Spirou, with a clown-like demeanour, and his hairstyle resembled that of [[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] character [[Dagwood Bumstead]].  In the Franquin era, he and Spirou became more alike.  He has an evil megalomaniac cousin, [[Zantafio]], who is his sworn enemy but bears a strong physical resemblance to him. For a full list of the comic strip's story and albums, please refer to the [[Spirou et Fantasio]] article.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In opposition to his role in ''Spirou'', in ''Gaston'' Fantasio was a serious character, playing straight man to Gaston's goofy antics, who thus becomes to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Fantasio &lt;/span&gt;what Fantasio is to Spirou. However, Fantasio left that series when [[AndrÃ© Franquin]] left ''Spirou et Fantasio'' after the album ''Panade Ã  Champignac'' (taking Gaston and the [[Marsupilami]] with him), being replaced in the role by [[Gaston Lagaffe#The office co-workers|LÃ©on Prunelle]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
