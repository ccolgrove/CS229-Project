The Soviet soldiers who surrendered were declared traitors; however most of those who survived the brutality of German captivity were mobilized again as they were freed. Between 5% and 10% of them were sent to [[Gulag]] (As &quot;traitors of Homeland&quot;. Soviet Criminal Code, Â§58, clause 1B: criminal conviction &amp;amp;mdash; 10 or later 25 years of labor camp plus 5 years without &quot;citizen rights&quot;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
