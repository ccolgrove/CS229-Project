  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;* An [[NSA]] research project called '''SELinux''' ([[Security-Enhanced Linux]]) added a Mandatory Access Control architecture to the [[Linux Kernel]], which was merged into the mainline version of Linux in August 2003. It utilizes a Linux 2.6 kernel feature called [[Linux Security Modules|LSM]] (Linux Security Modules interface). [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] version 4 (and later versions) come with an SELinux-enabled kernel. Although SELinux is capable of restricting all processes in the system, the default ''targeted'' policy in [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]] confines the most vulnerable programs from the ''unconfined domain'' in which all other programs run. RHEL 5 ships 2 other binary policy types: ''strict'', which attempts to implement [[least privilege]], and ''MLS'', which is based on ''strict'' and adds [[Multilevel_security|MLS]] labels. RHEL 5 contains additional MLS enhancements and received 2 LSPP/RBACPP/CAPP/EAL4+ certifications in June 2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | author = National Information Assurance Partnership | url = http://www.niap-ccevs.org/cc%2Dscheme/vpl/ | title =The Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme Validated Products List | accessdate = 2008-03-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

AppArmor utilizes a Linux 2.6 kernel feature called [[Linux Security Modules|LSM]] (Linux Security Modules interface).  LSM provides a kernel [[application programming interface|API]] that allows modules of kernel code to govern access control.  AppArmor is not capable of restricting all programs and is not yet included in the kernel.org kernel source tree. In most Linux distributions MAC is not installed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
