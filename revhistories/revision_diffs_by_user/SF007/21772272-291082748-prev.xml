  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;RPM has also been falsely criticized for a lack of consistency in package names and content which can make automatic dependency handling difficult.  However, this is not a problem inherent in the RPM ''format'', but rather because of differing packaging guidelines among major [[Linux distribution]]s that use RPM in packaging such as [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[openSUSE]], and [[Mandriva Linux]].  When using packages that are from a particular distribution (say [[Red Hat Linux]]) or built for a particular distribution (for example Freshrpms for Fedora),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citeweb|title=Welcome to freshrpms.net.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The low level utility for managing RPM files, itself named rpm, does not follow dependency information automatically, requiring the user to manually download various RPM-files. This is similar to the dpkg utility in Debian. Moreover, circular dependencies between mutually dependent RPMs cannot be installed with rpm unless the user is aware that he needs to specify both on the rpm installer's parameter list first. This leads to what is known as '[[dependency hell]]', particularly for packages with many dependencies, each of which has its own large set of dependencies, and so on.  For this reason, wrappers around the rpm tool have been created to help ameliorate the problem. High level tools like [[Yellow Dog Updater Modified|yum]], [[urpmi]] and [[zypper]] are examples of such wrappers. This is similar to wrappers like &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;apt-get, &lt;/span&gt;smart and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;aptitude &lt;/span&gt;in &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Debian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
