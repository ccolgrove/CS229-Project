  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;POP-11 was at first implemented on a [[DEC]] [[PDP11]] computer in 1976, and was ported to VAX+VMS in 1980. It became Poplog around 1982. Although the first commercial sales were for VAX/VMS, from the mid-1980s the main Poplog development work was done on Sun/[[SPARC]] computers running [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], although several different versions were sold, including versions for HPUX and a 64-bit version of Poplog for DEC Alpha running Digital Unix. After about 1999, when Poplog became available as free, open source, most development work was done on the Linux version, including porting to 64-bit linux.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There is a version for Windows, originally developed to support Clementine, but the Unix/Linux graphical subsystem does not work on Windows Poplog. However, the linux version of Poplog runs successfully under &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[VMWare]] &lt;/span&gt;on Windows. The Windows version of Clementine depended on a commercial package that supported X window functionality on Windows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
