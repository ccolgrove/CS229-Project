  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Autopackage is intended to be used for installing non-core applications such as [[word processor]]s, [[web browser]]s, and [[personal computer game]]s, rather than core [[library (computer science)|libraries]] and applications such as [[operating system shell]]s. For core applications and libraries, the distribution's native package manager is recommended for speed and compatibility reasons. Non-core libraries are something of a thorny issue, on the one hand packaging them allows installation on a greater range of systems, on the other hand there can be issues with conflicts when native packages are installed that depends on libraries that have been installed by autopackage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Autopackage is a complementary system to a distribution's usual packaging system, such as [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] and [[deb (file format)|deb]]. Unlike these formats, Autopackage verifies [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] by checking for the presence of files on the actual system, rather than querying a [[database]] of installed packages. Although this reduces compatibility &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;issues &lt;/span&gt;with different package naming conventions, it does mean that Autopackage is slower than distributions' native formats.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Autopackage uses [[APbuild]] to strip bogus dependencies, &quot;double-compile&quot; to make C++ programs compatible with different versions of [[g++]], and fix GLIBC version symbols, among other things. Programs that use autopackage must also be relocatable, meaning they can be installed into any location without needing to be recompiled. It is thus possible to install an autopackage as a non-root user in the user's home directory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
