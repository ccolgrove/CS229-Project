  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The process of rooting varies widely by device. It usually includes [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]ing a security weakness in the firmware shipped from the factory. For example, shortly after the [[T-Mobile G1]] was released it was quickly discovered that anything typed using the keyboard was being interpreted as a command in a privileged (root) shell. Although Google quickly released a patch to fix this, a signed image of the old firmware was leaked giving people the ability to downgrade and use the original exploit to gain root access. Once this exploit is found, a custom recovery image that does not check the [[digital signature]] of a firmware update package can be flashed. In turn, using the custom recovery, a modified firmware update can be installed that typically includes the utilities (for example the ''Superuser'' app) needed to run apps as root.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Recently, [[Motorola]], [[LG Electronics]] and [[HTC Corporation]] have added security features to their devices at the hardware level in an attempt to prevent retail Android devices from being rooted. For instance, the [[Motorola Droid X]] has a security boot-loader that will put the phone in &quot;recovery mode&quot; if unsigned firmware is loaded onto the device. This protection was defeated 6 days after the Motorola Droid X was released to the general public.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://techie-buzz.com/mobile-news/motorola-droid-x-rooted.html |title=Motorola Droid X Rooted! |publisher=Techie-buzz.com |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
