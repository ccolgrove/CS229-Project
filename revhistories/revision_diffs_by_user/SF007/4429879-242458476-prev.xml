The BootCD used to run the program to perform a restoration of a system disk uses a version of Linux, and therefore relies on different hardware drivers than Windows. It is not uncommon for a user to have made backups and then find that the BootCD cannot see one of the drives needed to perform a restore. This issue also affects many other backup/imaging programs as most rely on linux to perform restores. Some folks avoid these driver issues by using a plug-in of TrueImage on a BartPE disk (Acronis provides the Bart plug-in along with the TrueImage program) or a VistaPE disk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While enjoying a widespread reputation as Best in Class, based on earlier versions of its product and its versitile features, the TrueImage reputation has suffered since the Fall 2007 release of TrueImageHome Version 11, which, according to the forums has more bugs than prior versions. These problems are not limited to the driver issues associated with the Linux on the BootCD and therefore could not be avoid by using a BartPE ror VistaPE boot disk. Although Acronis released two updates to TrueImageHome 11 during the subsequent 9 months, most of the bugs were never repaired -- see for example: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
