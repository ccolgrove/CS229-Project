Dell also modifies the half live vote to prop up ideas which they feel need more exposure, as they did for the poll asking which topics Micheal Dell would be more important to cover at the 2007 LinuxWorld conference. As articles are promoted, their score is increased, allowing Dell to rank which suggestions and requests are considered most important by the website's users. A page is maintained to demonstrate how Dell is acting upon the suggestions, the page is only changed when the status of an idea changes to IMPLEMENTED, no information is provided as to which ideas are being acted on till then. The idea process involves much discussion which at time leads to more ideas, yet Dell continues to remove comments (besides comments which are in bad taste) which leads to confusion as the thought process of the comments is left disjointed and nonsensical at times. Voting has come under scrutiny with some members voting with more than one account, which generated the termed &quot;double dippers&quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/69986 IdeaStorm delete accounts without a unique email or traceroute]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;, Dell has added some measures to help discourage this but is still working on preventing it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
