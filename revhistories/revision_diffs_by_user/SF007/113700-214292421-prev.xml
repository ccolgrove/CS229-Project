  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Later that morning, Captain Haddock comes across Castafiore in a [[Brussels]] street, and in order to avoid her, dashes into the nearby Fourcart Gallery, where he meets [[Jamaican]] [[avant-garde]] artist RamÃ³ Nash (the master of 'Alph-Art') and the owner of the gallery, Henri Fourcart. Fourcart displays considerable interest in meeting Tintin. At the gallery, Haddock is pressured into purchasing a perspex letter 'H' ('Personalph-Art') created by Nash. That evening, when Haddock returns to [[Marlinspike Hall|Marlinspike]], he and Tintin watch a news report about their old friend [[Ben Kalish Ezab and Abdullah|Emir Ben Kalish Ezab]], who, flushed with [[petroleum|oil]] profits, arrogantly plans to buy [[Windsor Castle]] from the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in [[Paris]]. The same news programme then features a report on the suspicious death of art expert Jacques Monastir, who is presumed drowned off the coast of [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next morning, Tintin learns that Fourcart was killed in a car accident, apparently en route to visit him. He visits the gallery to &quot;make a few enquiries&quot; and meets Martine Vandezande, the gallery assistant, who wears large glasses and a strange pendant resembling two E's lined back to back. She discusses the death of her former employer and her conversation with Tintin is recorded by a reel-to-reel tape recorder hidden under the counter. Tintin then visits the Garage de l'Avenir at Leignault, where the mechanic tells him the location of Fourcart's car crash. Tintin drives there on his motor scooter and is pursued by a black Mercedes. At the scene, Tintin discovers the 'accident' to be no such thing; Fourcart was murdered. The drivers of the black Mercedes then make a botched attempt on Tintin's life. He returns to Marlinspike and tells the Captain about the events of the day. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
