  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The vitreous is the transparent, colourless, gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly [[phagocytes]] which remove unwanted cellular debris in the [[visual field]], as well as the [[hyalocytes of Balazs]] of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the [[hyaluronic acid]]), no blood vessels, and 98-99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of [[collagen]] type II fibers with the glycosaminoglycan [[hyaluronic acid]], and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts.  Amazingly, with so little solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.  The lens, on the other hand, is tightly packed with cells.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica from &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;EncyclopÃ¦dia &lt;/span&gt;Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;DVD &lt;/span&gt;2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  However, the vitreous has a [[viscosity]] two to four times that of pure water, giving it a gelatinous consistency.
