The service allows users to install available applications using a single click. CNR also includes a set of ''Click and Buy'' (CNB) software, which includes many commercial applications to members at a discounted rate. Currently CNR has over 38,000 different software packages, ranging from simple applications to major commercial works such as [[Win4Lin]] and [[OpenOffice.org|StarOffice]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linspire.com/lindows_products_categories.php | title = CNR Warehouse - catalogue of software titles downloadable via CNR | accessdate = 2006-04-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; CNR was originally subscription-based with two tiers: ''basic'' service cost $20 annually, and ''gold'', featuring discounts on some commercial applications, $50.
