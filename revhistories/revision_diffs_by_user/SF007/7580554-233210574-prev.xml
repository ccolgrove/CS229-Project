  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The FreeBSD Project is run by FreeBSD committers, or developers who have [[Concurrent_Versions_System|CVS]]/[[Subversion (software)|SVN]] commit access. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team who are responsible for overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new &quot;commit bits&quot;, or the granting of CVS/SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, including responsibility for security advisories (the Security Officer Team), release engineering (the Release Engineering Team) and managing the ports collection (the Port Manager team).  Developers may give up their commit rights to retire or for &quot;safe-keeping&quot; after a period of a year or more of inactivity, although commit rights will generally be restored on request. Under rare circumstances commit rights may be removed by Core Team vote as a result of repeated violation of project rules and standards. The FreeBSD Project is unusual among open source projects in having developers who have worked with its source base for over 25 years, owing to the involvement of a number of past University of California developers who worked on [[BSD]] at the [[Computer Systems Research Group|CSRG]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
