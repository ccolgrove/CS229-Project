  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Under Linux, how video is finally drawn depends largely on the [[x window manager]] in use. With properly installed drivers, and [[graphics processing unit|GPU]] hardware such as supported [[Intel]], [[ATI]], and [[nVidia]] chip sets, some [[window managers]], called [[compositing window manager]]s allow windows to be separately processed and then rendered (or composited). This involves all windows being rendered to separate output buffers in memory first, and later combined to form a complete graphical interface. While in (video) memory, individual windows can be transformed separately, and accelerated video may be added at this stage using a texture filter, before the window is composited and drawn. XVideo can also be used to accelerate video playback during the drawing of windows using an OpenGL [[Framebuffer Object]] or pbuffer. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Metacity]], an [[X window manager]] uses compositing in this way. The compositing can also make use of 3D pipelines accelerations such as GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap. Among other things, this process allows many video outputs to share the same screen without interfering with each other. Other [[compositing window manager]]s such as [[Beryl]], [[Compiz]] and [[Compiz Fusion]] also user compositing. [[Compiz Fusion]] is included with [[Ubuntu &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] &lt;/span&gt;Linux 7.10 and later and is automatically enabled when suitable video hardware is detected. It can also be enabled from the &quot;Appearance&quot; dialog, in the System-&amp;gt;Preferences menu.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
