  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the Bess system, by installing between the workstation and the open internet, itself functions as a [[web proxy]], it is common for students to use web proxies to get around Bess. [[Anonymous web proxy|Anonymous web proxies]], which use familiar web interfaces, are the most straightforward bypassing method available.  While Bess may block the address of a known proxy, there are always more proxies remaining to be found.  Alternate browsers can also be used.  Since most schools use [[Internet Explorer]] and block access to its connection settings, a student can use another browser such as [[Firefox]] and configure it to use a secure [[proxy server]].  Web page translators can be used as proxies.  Although common ones like Google and Alta Vista are usually blocked by default under the &quot;P2P/Loopholes&quot; category, less common ones including those in another language are usually available.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
