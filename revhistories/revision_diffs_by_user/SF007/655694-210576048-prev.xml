Other processors that do not support PAE are [[AMD K6]] and earlier, [[Transmeta Crusoe]], [[VIA C3]] and earlier, and [[Geode]] GX and LX. Older versions of VMware, and even current versions of [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] and Parallels does not support PAE on the guest. [[Fedora Core|Fedora Core 6]] does provide a kernel-PAE package which supports PAE and NX though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
