  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Playstation 3 has been designed to run other operating systems from day one. Very soon after launch, the first users managed to install Fedora Core 5 onto the Playstation 3 via the 'Install Other OS' option in the PS3's XMB (Cross Media Bar), which also allows configuring the PS3 to boot into the other OS installed by default. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;So far, several Linux flavors have been successfully installed to the PS3, such as [[Fedora Core]] 5, Fedora Core 6, [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] (YDL). The latter comes installed with the Cell SDK by default, allowing programmers a low cost entry into Cell programming. See also: [[Linux for PlayStation 3]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At this point graphics support is limited to framebuffer access only (no access to the PS3's graphics chip RSX yet). Since [[NVIDIA]] has a good track record when it comes to releasing Linux drivers for its products, there is some hope that Linux on PS3 will be able to support the RSX graphics card eventually. In the meantime however, they will have to make do with framebuffer access and software-only implementations of OpenGL, such as [[Mesa 3D]]. A port of [[Lua Player]], which will implement Mesa 3D, is already underway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
