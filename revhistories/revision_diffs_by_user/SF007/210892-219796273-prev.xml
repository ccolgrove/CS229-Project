  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;To allow distributions of the code ''without'' using the official branding, the Firefox [[source code]] contains a &quot;branding switch&quot;.  This switch allows the code to be compiled without the official logo and name, for example to produce a derivative work unencumbered by restrictions on the Firefox trademark (this is also often used for betas and alphas of future Firefox versions).  In the unbranded compilation the trademarked logo and name are replaced with a freely distributable generic globe logo and the name of the release series from which the modified version was derived.  The name &quot;Deer Park&quot; is used for derivatives of Firefox 1.5, &quot;Bon Echo&quot; for derivatives of Firefox 2.0, and &quot;Gran Paradiso&quot; is used for derivatives of Firefox 3.0. The codename Minefield and a modified version of the generic logo stylised to look like a bomb is used for nightly trunk builds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
