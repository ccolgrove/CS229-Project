  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;TUX is capable of launching [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] programs to provide dynamic content.  However, CGI suffers from significant performance limitations.  Therefore, using CGI to provide dynamic content would completely negate all of the performance advantages of using TUX in the first place, and is therefore not recommended.  While TUX itself can only serve static web pages, whenever TUX receives a request that it is unsure of or unable to process, it can redirect the request to a traditional userspace web server daemon.  This allows TUX to handle both dynamic content and errors in a safer, faster, and [[Request for Comments|RFC]]-correct manner.  An example of such a user-space web server might be the [[Apache HTTP Server]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;TUX has never been an integrated part of the official Linux kernel, although it has been shipped in some distributions, notably Red Hat, SuSE and Fedora.  It served as a test bed (and motivator) for many features which were integrated separately.  One major component was the [[Native POSIX Thread Library]], which, with the right tuning parameters, allows userspace web servers to serve web pages at a speed very close to that of a [[kernelspace web server]] like TUX but without its limitations.  Core kernel developers also argued that having an HTTP daemon within the kernel is dangerous.  For example, a common bug such as a [[buffer overflow]] within TUX could give an attacker [[superuser]] control over the machine.  Therefore, it is much safer to keep the HTTP daemon entirely within userspace, where a bug does not necessarily give an attacker total control.  However, some Linux distributions, such as [[Fedora &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Core|Fedora]], &lt;/span&gt;have added TUX back into 2.6 kernels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
