  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lindow Moss is a peat bog in Mobberley, Cheshire, used as [[common land]] since the [[medieval]] period. It originally covered over {{convert|600|ha|acre}}, but has since shrunk to a tenth of its original size. The bog is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Brothwell13&quot;&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=13.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On 13&amp;amp;nbsp;May 1983, two peat workers at Lindow Moss, Andy Mould and Stephen Dooley, noticed an unusual object about the size of a football on the elevator taking peat to the shredding machine. They took the object off the elevator for closer inspection, joking that it was a dinosaur egg. Once the peat had been removed, their discovery turned out to be a decomposing, incomplete human head with one eye and some hair intact.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=11.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Forensics identified the skull as belonging to a woman, probably aged 30&amp;amp;ndash;50.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=11&amp;amp;ndash;12.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On hearing the news of the discovery of the remains Peter Reyn-Bardt, who lived near Lindow Moss, believed it was the body of his wife. Mrs Reyn-Bardt had disappeared in 1960 and was the subject of an ongoing investigation by police. Peter Reyn-Bardt confessed to the murder of his wife and was tried and convicted.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Brothwell12&quot;&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=12.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The skull was later [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]], revealing it to be nearly 2,000&amp;amp;nbsp;years old. &quot;Lindow Woman&quot;, as it became known, dated from around 210&amp;amp;nbsp;AD.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Brothwell12&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A further gruesome discovery was made at Lindow Moss, a year after Lindow Woman which was found just {{convert|250|m|ft}} to the north east of the new find. On 1&amp;amp;nbsp;August 1984, Andy Mould, who had been part of the discovery of Lindow Woman in 1983, took what he thought was a piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding machine.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=13&amp;amp;ndash;14.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human foot. The police were called and took the foot away for examination.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Brothwell13&quot;/&amp;gt; Rick Turner, the Cheshire [[County Archaeologist]], was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of Lindow Man's body. Some skin had been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was recovered with peat. The complete excavation of the peat block containing the remains was performed on 6&amp;amp;nbsp;August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield District Council Hospital for storage.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=14.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; At the time, the body was dubbed &quot;Pete Marsh&quot; (a pun on &quot;peat marsh&quot;) by Middlesex Hospital radiologists, a name subsequently adopted by local journalists.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Stead|Bourke|Brothwell|1986|p=12,&amp;amp;nbsp;16.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Lindow Man's official name is ''Lindow II'' as there are other finds from the area; ''Lindow I'' refers to two human skulls, ''Lindow III'' to fragments of a headless body, and ''Lindow IV'' to the upper thigh of an adult male, possibly that of Lindow Man.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;British museum&quot;&amp;gt;{{citation |title=Lindow Man |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/l/lindow_man.aspx |publisher=BritishMuseum.org}} Retrieved on 22&amp;amp;nbsp;September 2008.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In life, Lindow Man would have between 5'6&quot; (1.68&amp;amp;nbsp;m) and 5'8&quot; (1.73&amp;amp;nbsp;m) tall and have weighed about 10&amp;amp;nbsp;stone (132&amp;amp;nbsp;lb, 60&amp;amp;nbsp;kg). Only the top half of the body was recovered, but from that it was possible to ascertain it was that of a man in his mid-20s. The body retains a trimmed beard, moustache, and sideburns of brown/ginger hair as well as healthy teeth with no visible cavities and manicured fingernails, indicating he did little heavy or rough work. Apart from a fox-fur armband, Lindow Man was discovered completely naked.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;RB456&quot;&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Renfrew|Bahn|2006|p=456.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, however it was later revealed to be the result of a reaction between the [[keratin]] in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;RB456&quot;/&amp;gt; When he died, Lindow Man was suffering from slight [[osteoarthritis]] and an infestation of [[whipworm]] and maw worm.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Renfrew|Bahn|2006|pp=456&amp;amp;ndash;457.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Dating Lindow Man is problematic as samples from the body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to about 300&amp;amp;nbsp;BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=16&amp;amp;ndash;17.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; between about 20&amp;amp;nbsp;AD and 90&amp;amp;nbsp;AD.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;British museum&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As the peat was cleaned off the body in the laboratory, it became clear that Lindow Man had suffered a violent death. There was a {{convert|3|cm|in}} wound in the middle of the right [[collar bone]], a broken [[mandible|jaw]], a broken neck, a sinew thong wrapped around a cut throat, and [[xeroradiography]] revealed he also had his skull fractured by a blunt object. Although some of the damage to the body could have occurred  ''post mortem'', the strangulation (as proven by the thong and broken neck), cut throat, and head injury suggest Lindow Man was murdered.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=25&amp;amp;ndash;27.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; According to Brothwell, it is one of the most complex examples of &quot;[[overkill]]&quot; in a bog body, and possibly has ritual meaning as it was &quot;extravagant&quot; for a straightforward murder.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=28&amp;amp;ndash;29.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; With more than 100&amp;amp;nbsp;similarly executed bog bodies having been discovered across Europe, there is the possibility of a widespread ritual practice.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&amp;gt;{{citation |title=Lindow Man - the body in the bog - goes home to Manchester Museum |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/article3706773.ece |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |author=Richard Morrison |date=12&amp;amp;nbsp;April 2008}} Retrieved on 22&amp;amp;nbsp;September 2008.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lindow Man's last meal was preserved in his stomach and intestines and was analysed in some detail &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Holden, T G 1986 preliminary report on the detailed analysis of the macroscopic remains from the gut of Lindow Man, instead, I M, Bourke, J B &amp;amp; Brothwell, DR (eds), Lindow Man: The Body in the Bog. London: British Publications. 116-125&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of [[cereal]]s.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dr Anne Ross and Don Robins have suggested that Lindow Man was a high-status [[druid]], which would explain the evidence of minimal hard labour. They proposed that he was sacrificed, possibly during the feast of [[Beltane]], to invoke three Celtic gods against the Romans in the 1st century AD.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation |title=Back from the bog |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEED8163FF934A25755C0A966958260 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |author=Malcome W.

The body was frozen solid and the ice vaporised to ensure Lindow Man did not shrink.
