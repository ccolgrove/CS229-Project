  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''A Virtual Security Switch''' is a software [[Ethernet]] switch with embedded security controls within it that runs within Virtual Environments such as &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[VMWare]], &lt;/span&gt;[[Citrix]], [[Microsoft]] and Virtual Iron.  The primary purpose of a Virtual Security Switch is to provide security measures such as isolation, control and content inspection between virtual machines.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Virtual Machine]]s within enterprise server environments began to gain popularity in 2005 and quickly started to become a standard in the way companies deploy servers and applications.  In order to deploy these servers within a virtual environment, a virtual network needed to be formed and as a result companies such as &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;VMWare &lt;/span&gt;created a resource called a Virtual Switch.  The purpose of the Virtual Switch was to provide network connectivity within the Virtual Environment so that virtual machines and applications could communicate within the virtual network as well as to the physical network.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;This concept of a Virtual Network introduced a number of problems as it related to security within virtual environment due to only having virtual switching technology within the environment and not security technologies.  Unlike physical networks that have switches with ACLâs, [[Firewalls]], [[Anti-Virus]] Gateways, or [[intrusion prevention]] devices, the Virtual Network was very wide open.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Because [[Virtual Machine]]s are essentially operating systems &amp;amp; applications packaged into a single file called [[disk image]]s they have now become more mobile.  For the first time in history servers can be moved around, exchanged and file shared just like MP3 files shared on the Peer to Peer networks.  Administrators can now download pre-installed virtual servers via the internet to speed up the deployment time of new servers.  No longer is it required for an administrator to go through the lengthy software installation process, because these virtual disk images have pre-installed operating systems and applications.  They are in a sense, Virtual Appliances.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;This mobility of server images has now created the potential problem that entire servers can become infected and passed around in the wild.  Imagine downloading the latest [[Fedora]] [[Linux]] Server from a web site like ThoughtPolice.co.uk [http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk] , installing it in your virtual environment and later learning that there was a Trojan on that server that later took down your virtual network.  This could be catastrophic.  There is obviously the trust factor that now needs to be taken in account for when downloading virtual server images.  But who do you trust?  Do you trust downloading an image from &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;VMWareâs &lt;/span&gt;Virtual Market Place [http://www.vmware.com/appliances/]?  Do you trust installing one that the previous IT Manager within your company created?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Virtual Security Switch concept is one that monitors your trust decision by providing isolation and security monitoring between virtual machines.  A Virtual Security Switch can isolate VMâs from each other, restrict what types of communication is allowed between each other as well as monitor for the spread of malicious content or denial of service attacks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
