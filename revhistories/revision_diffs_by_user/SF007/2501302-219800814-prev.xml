The purpose of a splog can be to increase the [[PageRank]] or backlink portfolio of affiliate websites, to artificially inflate paid ad impressions from visitors, and/or use the blog as a link outlet to get new sites indexed. Spam blogs are usually a type of [[scraper site]], where content is often either [[inauthentic text]] or merely stolen (see ''[[blog scraping]]'') from other websites. These blogs usually contain a high number of [[hyperlink|link]]s to sites associated with the splog creator which are often disreputable or otherwise useless websites.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There is frequent confusion between the terms &quot;splog&quot; and &quot;[[spam in blogs]]&quot;. Splogs are blogs where the articles are fake, and are only created for search engine spamming. To spam in blogs, conversely, is to include random comments on the blogs of innocent bystanders, in which spammers take advantage of a site's ability to allow visitors to post comments that may include links.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
