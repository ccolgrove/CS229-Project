  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Carlos Eduardo Morimoto''' is the author of [[Kurumin]], a [[Linux distribution]] based on [[Knoppix]]. It was the most popular Linux distribution in [[Brazil]].  After almost ending the project, due to many complaints from users in his forums and technical problems, mostly caused by the fact that Kurumin was based on Debian unstable, which is not targeted to non-experienced users, and was the majority of Kurumin users. Now Kurumin is based in Kubuntu, and Leandro Santos, the developer of Kalango &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;linux(another &lt;/span&gt;distro based in Kurumin) joined efforts with Morimoto to develop the new version of Kurumin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
