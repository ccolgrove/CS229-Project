  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The quiet [[pianist]] working for [[Bianca Castafiore]]. In ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]'' he is discovered to be a gambler who bets by telephone on races in secret. He has a small moustache and dresses formally in black with black shoes. After the thievery of Castafiore's emeralds, his attempts to help more often than not incriminated himself, as his footprints were found near Castafiore's window, he was suspiciously rummaging in the attic, and later broke a step on the staircase. He also tries to sneak out of his hour-long training sessions (dictated by Castafiore). Being the long-time accompanist for Castafiore, his name is made up of a humorous reference to two very well known composers:  [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
