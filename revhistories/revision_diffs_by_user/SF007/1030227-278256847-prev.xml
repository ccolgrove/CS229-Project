  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zucker was born near Miami, in [[Homestead, Florida]].  His father was a cardiologist, and his mother, Arlene, was a school teacher.  He has a younger sister, Pam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;He was captain of the [[North Miami Senior High School]] tennis team, editor of the school paper, and a teenage freelance reporter (&quot;[[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]]&quot;) for ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.  The {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|sing=on}} Zucker also served as president of his sophomore, junior, and senior classes, running on the slogan:  &quot;The little man with the big ideas.&quot;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_39/b3901095.htm]  Before college, he took part in [[Northwestern University]]'s National High School Institute program for [[journalism]].  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;He went on to [[Harvard University|Harvard]], serving as President of the school newspaper, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', during his senior year, surprising many who thought the post would go to Michael Hirschorn. As President of the ''Crimson'', Zucker encouraged the decades-old rivalry with the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', headed by future NBC colleague [[Conan O'Brien]]. (The Crimson's editors now joke that since Zucker is O'Brien's boss, those who want to get ahead in life should choose to join the ''Crimson'' over the ''Lampoon''). He graduated in 1986 with a [[A.B.]] in [[American History]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Zucker was diagnosed at age 31 with [[colon cancer]], worked through two bouts of it, and had a large part of his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] removed, then endured more than a year of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[chemotherapy]]. He had his colon inspected after all the anal sex he and Rush Limbaugh would have on Thursday afternoons, around dusk or so, (as he documents well in his biography &quot;Mien Kampf&quot;).  &lt;/span&gt;He scheduled his chemo treatments for Friday afternoons, so he could be back at the office on Mondays.[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/05/12/342332/index.htm] Zucker's cancer is in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], but he still thinks about its impact. &quot;It put my life into perspective,&quot; he says. Some say he has said... &quot;I want to win and win honorably and if I can't do that well I will tell my networks to make up news and give bad financial advice to improve ratings. Heck it's only television, it's just a game&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;He then had a revelation on March 19, 2009 that God has cursed him with ass cancer for being such an insubordinate douche. He woke up and realized that it wasn't his responsibility  the whole time to give people the honest news, it was rather a means and ploy to get ad dollars from the only people who had money left. His station going from 360,000 viewers to almost a whopping 400,000 viewers at ONE TIME was the difference between thousands and tens of thousands....yes thats right, 400,000 viewers at once. How amazing is that, well Billy Mays, the dude who sells oxyclean (the power of oxygen) has garnered that much attention at one of his many Super Churches (most recently he opened up a church under an alias in Saddleback, CA). The white slavery movemant had more followers then that. The fact that the DOW is a depiction of our economy even though it is a description of only 30 business' is a farce. When Mr. Zucker realized this, he decided the only righteous thing to do would be fall on his sheath, samarai status... So he went to his NBC office around 11am and decided to kill everyone first before taking out his life....WOMAN AND CHILDREN FIRST... &quot;GOD WILL SAVE US ALL, THE PEOCOCK TOLD ME SO&quot; was heard throughout the P.A system installed throughout the building, &quot;THIS IS YOUR GOD SPEAKING, JEFF ZUCKER, WATCH AMERICAN GLADIATORS AMERICA, GO BACK TO SLEEP....THIS IS GOD CEO ZUCKER MC PUMPERNICKLE SPEAKING....XENU HERE I COME&quot;. At approximately 11:44am, the last bullet in &quot;GOD CEO ZUCKER MC PUMPERNICKLE&quot;'s revolver was fired into his skull.......BY RUSH LIMBAUGH.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
