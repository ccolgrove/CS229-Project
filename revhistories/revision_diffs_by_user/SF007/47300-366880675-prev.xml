  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type pagesetting was quicker and more durable for alphabetic scripts. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type, and [[printing press]]es rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;In 1997, [[Time Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium.
