  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After releasing two release candidate versions, 1.0rc1 on July 25, 2005 and 1.0rc2 on October 25, 2005, instead of making a final release, the project developers started adding many new features, with the final release being repeatedly postponed. Instead, there were binary packages of the latest [[Subversion|SVN]] version made available on a daily basis, called &quot;nightly builds&quot;. These were supported better than the latest official 1.0rc2 release. While this approach provided users with bleeding-edge improvements and allowed developers to get constant feedback, it created an outside illusion that the project was stagnant (because no new releases have been made).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
