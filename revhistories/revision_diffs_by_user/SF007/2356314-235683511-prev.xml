  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;One can distinguish several different types of open source projects. First, there is the garden variety of software programs and libraries. They are standalone pieces of code. Some might even be dependent on other open source projects. These projects serve a specified purpose and fill a definite need. Examples of this type of project include the [[Linux kernel]], the [[MZILA &amp;amp; MAGWAZA Firefox|Firefox]] web-browser and [[OpenOffice.org]] office suite of tools.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Distributions are another type of open source project. Distributions are collections of software that are published from the same source with a common purpose. The most prominent example of a &quot;distribution&quot; is an operating system. There are a large number of [[Linux]] distributions (such as [[Debian]], [[Fedora Core]], [[Mandriva]], [[Slackware]], etc.) which ship the Linux kernel along with many user-land components. There are also other distributions, like [http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ ActivePerl], the [[Perl|Perl programming language]] for various operating system, and even the [http://www.theopencd.org/ OpenCD] and [[cygwin]] distributions of open-source programs for [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other open source projects, like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] derivatives, maintain the source code of an entire operating system, the kernel and all of its core components, in one [[revision control]] system; developing the entire system together as a single team. These operating system development projects closely integrate their tools: more so than in the other distribution-based systems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
