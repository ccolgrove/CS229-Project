In [[Mac OS X]], pressing one of these key combinations creates the accent and highlights it, then produces the finalized character when a supported character is pressed, otherwise it leaves the accent remaining. Some accented vowels, such as ''[[Åµ]]'' (used in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), cannot be accessed without first changing the keyboard layout. Some accented vowels are also unsupported. The US keyboard layout, which predates Unicode, provides access only to characters found in the legacy Mac Roman character set and does not support other [[diacritic]]s, such as ''Ë'' ([[caron]]), that are not commonly found in Western European languages (but which are commonly used in many [[Eastern Europe]]an languages). However, the Mac OS X U.S. Extended keyboard layout, which was released after Unicode support became common, does provide access to many more diacritics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
