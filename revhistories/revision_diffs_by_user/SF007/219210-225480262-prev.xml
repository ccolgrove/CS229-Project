  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;When Sega's [[Dreamcast]] was released [[9 September]] 1999, it came with a newer disc format, called the [[GD-ROM]]. Using a modified CD player, one could access the game functionality. Using a special swap method could allow reading a GD-ROM game through a CD-ROM just using common MIL-CD (standard CD Boot loading, commonly found on Windows Installation Discs, Linux &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;LiveCDs, &lt;/span&gt;and others).  Sega DreamCasts sold after October 2000 contain a newer firmware update, not allowing MIL-CD boot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The [[Microsoft Xbox]], has a specific function: Non-booting or non-reading from [[CD]]s and [[DVD-R]]s as a method of game copy protection. Also, the Xbox is said to use a different DVD file system (instead of UDF). It has been theorized that the discs have a second partition that is read from the outside in (opposite current standards thus making the second partition unreadable in PC DVD drives) which give the tracks the appearance that the disc was spun backwards during manufacture. This format (and the aforementioned hardware lockouts) appears to have been inherited by its successor, the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
