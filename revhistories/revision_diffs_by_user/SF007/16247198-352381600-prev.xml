This was proven to be true at MIX10, where they demonstrated support for basic SVG markup and improved support for HTML5. They also announced that they will increase the support greatly by the time the first IE 9 beta is released. The IE team has also introduced the new JavaScript engine, codenamed Chakra, which compiles code to native code.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://news.softpedia.com/news/Internet-Explorer-9-Beta-Next-New-IE9-Builds-Every-8-Weeks-138013.shtml&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While at MIX10, a platform preview was released. It was not a full build of IE, as it was for testing the latest version of the [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] layout engine. It contained a minimalistic user interface. It is for web developers to send feedback on the improvements made. Microsoft say that it will be updated approximately every eight weeks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
