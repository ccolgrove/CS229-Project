According to both the Hawaii state government website and a June 6, 2009 article in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, the computer-generated Certification of Live Birth is the only kind of birth record now issued by the state (original records are stored electronically), so the distinction between &quot;short-form&quot; and &quot;long-form&quot; is moot. When a citizen of Hawaii requests a certified copy of his or her birth certificate from the state, a Certification of Live Birth â what people are calling the &quot;short-form,&quot; and what Obama released to the public in 2008 â is what they get.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the wake of Trump's statements about US President Obama,  NBC and The Apprentice have been criticized for its involvement with Trump.  There have been public calls for NBC to fire Trump from his role on The Apprentice-- most notably from sister-network host Lawrence O'Donnell and from US Congressman Anthony Weiner.  &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://nation.foxnews.com/donald-trump/2011/04/08/msnbc-host-wants-parent-company-fire-trump MSNBC Host Wants Parent Company to Fire Trump] [http://washingtonscene.thehill.com/in-the-know/36-news/9131-weiner-nbc-should-tell-trump-youre-fired Weiner: NBC Should Tell Trump &quot;You're Fired&quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
