  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trump has several projects under way. The level of success of the progress of the projects varies. The [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Honolulu)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; Honolulu]] seems to be a success. According to Trump, buyers paid non-refundable deposits to commit to purchase every unit on the first day they were made available. Construction of the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; Chicago]] seems to be proceeding as planned although 30% of the units remain unsold. The [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Toronto)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; Toronto]] has had a series of delays and a height reduction. The [[Trump Tower (Tampa)|Trump Tower&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; Tampa]] has been quite controversial because the initial sales were so successful that all deposits were returned to charge a higher price. Three years after construction of this controversial development began, construction has delayed and lawsuits have been filed. In [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] one Trump construction project was put on hold in favor of another ([[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Fort Lauderdale)|Trump International Hotel and Tower&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; Fort Lauderdale]]). Meanwhile, [[Trump Towers (Atlanta)|Trump Towers&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; Atlanta]] is being developed in a housing market which has the nation's second-highest inventory of unsold homes.&amp;lt;ref name=SCPTTN&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119517867398895020.html|title=Stalled Condo Projects Tarnish Trump's Name|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp;amp; Company]]|accessdate=2008-05-22|date=2007-11-16|first=Alex|last=Frangos}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
