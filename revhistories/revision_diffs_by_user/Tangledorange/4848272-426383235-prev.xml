  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On April 25, 2011 on Anderson Cooper 360 (CNN), Trump said he wanted President Obama to end the issue by releasing a long form Certificate of Live Birth (distinct from the short form Certification of Live Birth, which is Hawaii's prima facie evidence of birth). According to both the Hawaii state government website and a June 6, 2009 article in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, the computer-generated Certification of Live Birth is the only kind of birth record now issued by the state (original records are stored electronically), so the distinction between &quot;short-form&quot; and &quot;long-form&quot; is moot. When a citizen of Hawaii requests a certified copy of his or her birth certificate from the state, a Certification of Live Birth â what people are calling the &quot;short-form,&quot; and what Obama released to the public in 2008 â is what they get. According to Hawaii Health Department spokesperson Janice Okubo, a COLB contains &quot;all the information needed by all federal government agencies for transactions requiring a birth certificate.&quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title= Obama's Birth Certificate |url= http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/obama_birth_certificate.htm |last=Emery |first=David |work=About.com |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On April 22, 2011, The Politico had speculated: &quot;Hawaii law prevents the long-form record from being photocopied or released to anyone â including Obama.
