  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;'''Occupy Cal''' is an ongoing series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in Berkeley based in the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[Sproul Plaza]]. It started on November 9, 2011, in protest of budget increases the UC Regents will vote on November 16, 2011.  It is an offshoot of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement.  A major theme of this particular demonstration is the role of education in creating jobs and improving the quality of life of society as a whole, and the contrasting failure of the [[UC Regents]] and the State of California to honor commitments made in the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]]. Recent 81% tuition increases for students, mandatory furloughs (including for professors), firings of lower-ranking workers (especially those working directly with students) as part of the Berkeley [http://oe.berkeley.edu Operational Excellence] reorganization, and well-publicized raises for the highest paid administrators [http://www.sacbee.com/statepay/ link here] have further fueled discontent. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
