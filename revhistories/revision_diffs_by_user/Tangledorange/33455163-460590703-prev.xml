In the evening of November 9, law enforcement from Oakland Police, Alameda County Sheriff, and UC Police attempted to evict the members of OccupyCal from their encampment on the campus.  Several students and at least one professor were arrested.  In line with the earlier general assembly vote, members of Occupy Oakland joined in the Berkeley protest. After police removed the tents from the UC Berkeley encampment, protestors held a general assembly.  It voted 569-31 in favor of an educational General Strike to be held state-wide on November 15, 2011.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
