  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Criticism has been leveled at the series for allegedly giving jobs to the season winners that are less than what they are claimed to be on the show. Whereas winners have been named &quot;executive vice presidents&quot;, and given the title of &quot;owner's representative,&quot; in actuality, they were employed as publicity spokespeople for the Trump organization. Second season winner [[Kelly Perdew]], on his first day working for Trump, was introduced by his boss to Florida developers working on a Trump-branded condo, the [[Trump Tower (Tampa)|Trump Tower]], in [[Tampa, Florida]], where he was told that he would help promote sales of the building by appearing at promotional events.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Setoodeh, Ramin.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the wake of Trump's statements about US President Obama,  The Apprentice has been criticized for its involvement with Trump.  There have been public call for NBC to fire Trump from his role on The Apprentice-- most notably from sister-network host Lawrence O'Donnell and from US Congressman Anthony Weiner.
