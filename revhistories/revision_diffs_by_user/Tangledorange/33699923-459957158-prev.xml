After the incidents of vandalism, members of Occupy Oakland organized to guard local businesses, board up broken windows, and clean graffiti caused by the [[black bloc]] vandals.  Oakland mayor Jean Quan described the vandals as &quot;a small and isolated group&quot; that &quot;shouldn't mar the overall impact of the demonstration and the fact that people in the 99 percent movement demonstrated peacefully and, for the most part, were productive and very peaceful.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F11%2F03%2FBACM1LQ5FU.DTL]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
