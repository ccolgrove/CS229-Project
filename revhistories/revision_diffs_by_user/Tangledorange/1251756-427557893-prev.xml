  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The pace car was used to take the starting field on one unscored lap. The field would use the lap to warm up their engines, tires, and then at the conclusion of the lap, at a prescribed speed, the pace car would pull off the track and allow for a rolling, or &quot;flying,&quot; start. Fisher himself drove the pace car in several early years, but it eventually became an honorary position, with invitations extended to notable figures in auto racing or the automobile industry. The driver listed was invited to perform the honor of &quot;pacemaker.&quot; In later years, [[popular culture|pop culture]] celebrities &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;were among those, on occasion, invited to drive the &lt;/span&gt;pace &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;car.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In most years through the early 1950s, the pace car led the field around the track for one warm up lap, and then the race began. By 1957, the pace car led the field for two warm up laps. In approximately 1974, it was changed to the current three warm up laps (two &quot;[[parade]] laps&quot; and one &quot;pace lap&quot;). During the &quot;parade&quot; lap, often several replica festival pace cars join the field, usually carrying celebrities or special guest drivers. They pull off the track, and the lone pace car leads the field on the &quot;pace&quot; lap.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
