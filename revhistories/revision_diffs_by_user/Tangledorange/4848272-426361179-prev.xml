According to both the Hawaii state government website and a June 6, 2009 article in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, the computer-generated Certification of Live Birth is the only kind of birth record now issued by the state (original records are stored electronically), so the distinction between &quot;short-form&quot; and &quot;long-form&quot; is moot. When a citizen of Hawaii requests a certified copy of his or her birth certificate from the state, a Certification of Live Birth â what people are calling the &quot;short-form,&quot; and what Obama released to the public in 2008 â is what they get.
