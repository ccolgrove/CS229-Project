  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;London joined the [[Socialist Labor Party]] in April 1896. In the same year, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' published a story about the twenty-year-old London giving nightly speeches in Oakland's &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;City &lt;/span&gt;Hall &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Park, &lt;/span&gt;an activity he was arrested for a year later. In 1901, he left the Socialist Labor Party and joined the new [[Socialist Party of America]]. He ran unsuccessfully as the high-profile Socialist nominee for mayor of Oakland in 1901 (receiving 245 votes) and 1905 (improving to 981 votes), toured the country lecturing on socialism in 1906, and published collections of essays about socialism (''The War of the Classes'', 1905; ''Revolution, and other Essays'', 1906). As London explained in his essay, &quot;How I Became a Socialist&quot;, his views were influenced by his experience with people at the bottom of the social pit. His optimism and individualism faded, and he vowed never to do more hard work than necessary. He wrote that his individualism was hammered out of him, and he was politically reborn. He often closed his letters &quot;Yours for the Revolution.&quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See Labor (1994) p. 546 for one example, a letter from London to William E. Walling dated November 30, 1909.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
