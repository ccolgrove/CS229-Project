Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  They developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce improved results over the basic techniques then in use. (At the time, other search engines ranked results essentially based on how many times the search term appeared on a page.) It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called [[RankDex]] was already exploring a similar strategy.)  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] website with the domain ''google.stanford.edu'' (see the [http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Internet Archive Wayback Machine] search for [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://google.stanford.edu http://google.stanford.edu]).

They formally incorporated their company, ''Google Inc.'', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
