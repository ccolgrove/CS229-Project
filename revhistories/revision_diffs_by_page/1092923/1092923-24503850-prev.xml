  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. One such example is the rivalry between Microsoft and Google [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. The two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail ([[Gmail]] vs. [[Hotmail]]), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's [[Virtual Earth]] competes with [[Google Earth]]). Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing its own [[operating system]] to directly compete with [[Microsoft Windows]]. Rumors of a google browser are fueled by the fact that Google is the owner of the [[domain name]] &quot;gbrowser.com&quot;. This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. Microsoft has been touting its new [[MSN Search]] engine to counter Google's competitive position. This feud boiled over into the courts when Kai-Fu Lee, a former vice-president of Microsoft, quit Microsoft to work for Google. Microsoft sued to stop his move by citing Lee's non-compete contract (he had access to much sensitive information regarding Microsoft's plans in China). [http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=internetNews&amp;amp;storyID=2005-09-02T215817Z_01_MCC278865_RTRIDST_0_NET-MICROSOFT-GOOGLE-DC.XML] The case is still in the courts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While Google is the #1 search &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;engine overall, &lt;/span&gt;the company struggles to keep up with rivals such as the well known Yahoo. Although Google and Yahoo differ greatly in the services they offer, Google is trying to redefine itself from an internet search company to an internet media company, similar to Yahoo. Google is trying to become a jack of all trades for the internet. They are foraying into other businesses which other companies have recently dominated. On June 21st 2005 Google announced it has plans to release a pay service and a classified ads service, to rival companies like Ebay [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/20/business/google.php].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
