  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in early [[1996]] by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students who developed the theory that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;ass &lt;/span&gt;gained a following among [[Internet]] users for its simple, clean design and relevant search results. [[Advertisement]]s were sold by the [[keyword]] so that they would be more relevant to the end user, and the ads were text-based in order to keep page design uncluttered and fast-loading. The concept of selling Keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Overture]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml], formerly Goto.com. While many of its [[dot-com]] siblings went under, Google quietly rose in stature while turning a profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
