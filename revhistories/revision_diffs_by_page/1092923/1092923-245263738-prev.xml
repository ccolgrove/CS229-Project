  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The size of Google's search system is presently undisclosed. The site, also referred to by the media as ''Project 02'', was chosen due to the availability of inexpensive [[hydroelectric power]] and a large surplus of [[fiber optic]] cable, remnants of the dot com boom of the late 1990s. The computing center is estimated to be the size of two [[American football|football fields]], and it has created hundreds of construction jobs, causing local real estate prices to increase 40%. Upon completion, the center is expected to create 60 to 200 permanent jobs in the town of 12,000 people.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Project02&quot;&amp;gt;Markoff, John; Hansell, Saul. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ei=5088&amp;amp;en=c96a72bbc5f90a47&amp;amp;ex=1307937600&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=print Hiding in Plain Sight, Google Seeks More Power].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]].'' 14 June 2006.
