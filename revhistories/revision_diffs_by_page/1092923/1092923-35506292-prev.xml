  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On June 2005, [[Google Watch]] revealed the details of a contract between the [[University of Michigan]] and Google to create digitized copies of the copyrighted materials stored at the University's library.  This contract is part of [[List of Google services and tools#Book Search|Google Print]]'s effort to digitize millions of books and make the full text searchable.  There are claims that it is a violation of copyright laws to use copyrighted material for profit by placing search ads beside the search results of these digitized books.  Also, Google is setting a new precedent by making digital copies of copyrighted material on a wide scale without explicit permission from copyright holders.  Meanwhile, Google claims that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.  The contract between Google and the U. of Michigan does make it clear that Google will provide only excerpts of copyright text in a search. The contract says that it will comply with &quot;[[fair use]]&quot;, an exemption in copyright law that allows people to reproduce portions of text of copyrighted material for research purposes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
