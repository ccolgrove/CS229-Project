  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as [[Square root of two|&amp;amp;#8730;2]] = 1.4142135...) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control. The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo!]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by [[insiders]] which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
