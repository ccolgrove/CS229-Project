  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In January 2006 Google affirmed its intent to filter certain keywords given to it by the Chinese government. The restrictions will apply to thousands of terms and websites.[http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/01/24/D8FBCF686.html] The censored content will appear on a website called google.cn.

In its defense, Google stated that its rankings are its constitutionally protected opinions of the web sites that it indexes.  A judge subsequently threw out SearchKing's lawsuit in mid-2003 on precisely these grounds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
