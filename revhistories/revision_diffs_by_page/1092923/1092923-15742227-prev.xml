In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google got a big break in [[1999]] when [[Altavista]], the most popular search engine among knowledgeable users, relaunched as a portal and alienated those users.  Google quickly outgrew the University Avenue site.  After further outgrowing two other sites, the company settled on a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine gained a following among [[Internet]] users for its simple, clean design (imitating the early Altavista) and relevant search results. In [[2000]], Google had begun selling [[advertisement]]s by the [[keyword]] so that they would be more relevant to the end user. The ads were text-based in order to keep page design uncluttered and fast-loading. The concept of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Overture]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml], &lt;/span&gt;formerly Goto.com. While many of its [[dot-com]] siblings went under, Google quietly rose in stature while turning a profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
