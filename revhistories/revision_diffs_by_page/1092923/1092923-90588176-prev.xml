  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since [[2001]], Google has acquired several small start-up companies, often consisting of innovative teams and products. One of the earlier companies that Google bought was [[Pyra Labs]]. They were the creators of [[Blogger]], a weblog publishing platform, first launched in [[1999]]. This acquisition lead to many premium features becoming free. Pyra Labs was originally formed by [[Evan Williams]], yet he left Google in [[2004]]. In early [[2006]], Google acquired Upstartle, a company responsible for the online word processor, Writely. The technology in this product was used by Google to eventually create [[Google Docs &amp;amp; Spreadsheets]]. In late [[2006]], Google bought online video site [[YouTube]] for [[United States Dollar|$]]1.65 &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;billion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;La &lt;/span&gt;Monica, Paul R. &quot;[http://money.cnn.com/2006/10/09/technology/googleyoutube_deal/index.htm?cnn=yes Google to buy YouTube for $1.65 billion].&quot; ''[[CNN]].''

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has also worked with large companies to improve production and services, including a long-term research partnership with [[NASA]] in a variety of areas, and a partnership with [[Sun Microsystems]] to help share and distribute each other's technologies. Recently, Google entered into partnerships with [[Time Warner]]'s [[America Online]], to enhance each other's video search services, and with [[News Corporation|News Corp.'s]] Fox Interactive Media to provide search and advertising on the popular social networking site, [[MySpace]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originally, typical salaries at Google were considered to be quite low by industry standards. For example, some [[system administrator]]s earned no more than $33,000 &amp;amp;mdash; $40,000 per year; at that time it was considered to be low for the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] job market. Nevertheless, Google's excellent stock performance following the IPO has enabled these early employees to be competitively compensated by participation in the corporation's remarkable equity growth. In 2005, Google has implemented other employee incentives such as the [[Google Founders' Award]], in addition to offering higher salaries to new employees. Google's workplace amenities, culture, global popularity, and strong brand recognition have also attracted potential applicants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
