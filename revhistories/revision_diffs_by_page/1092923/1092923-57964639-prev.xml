  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the [[2006 MTV Movie Awards]] a small comedy sketch was made, where &quot;The Creator of Google&quot; Ron Google, hacked into MTV and told everyone what people were searching. He told everyone that Seth Rogan ([[The 40 Year Old Virgin]]), had looked up Jessica Alba over 10,000 times. When Alba asked what he was looking for, he said he wanted to see her feet. Ron Google, then said Jessica Alba, had recently looked up &quot;Hot Juicy Porn&quot;, which Alba dismissed as a typo, as she was cooking and looked up &quot;Hot Juicy Pork&quot; (though it should be noted the &quot;r&quot; key and the &quot;k&quot; key on the keyboard of a computer are not really close to one another.) Ron Google then left, saying that he just bought MTV, and that [[Yahoo]] was his bitch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As Google grows, many analysts are finding that the company is becoming more &quot;corporate&quot;.
