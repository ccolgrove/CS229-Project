  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While Google is the #1 search engine, the company struggles to keep up with rivals such as the well known Yahoo. Although Google and Yahoo differ greatly in the services they offer, Google is trying to redefine itself from an Internet search company to an Internet media company, similar to Yahoo!. Google is trying to become a jack of all trades for the Internet. They are foraying into other businesses which other companies have recently dominated.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the third quarter 2005 Google Conference Call, Eric Schmidt said, &quot;We don't do the same thing as &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;every &lt;/span&gt;else does.
