Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University]] website with the domain ''google.stanford.edu''. The domain ''google.com'' was registered on [[September 14]], [[1997]], and the company was incorporated as ''Google Inc.'' on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California]].  The total initial investment raised for the new company eventually amounted to almost US$1.1 million, including a $100,000 check by [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], one of the founders of [[Sun Microsystems]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Google. &quot;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Google Milestones].&quot; Accessed [[2006-07-12]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In March, 1999, the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], home to several other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups. After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company settled into their current home in a complex of buildings in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, also in 1999.  The complex has since become known as the [[Googleplex]] (a play on the word [[googolplex]], a 1 followed by a googol of zeros). [[Silicon Graphics]] leased the buildings to Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
