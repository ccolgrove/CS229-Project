  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On June 2005, [[Google Watch]] revealed the details of a contract between the [[University of Michigan]] and Google to create digitized copies of the copyrighted materials stored at the University's library.  This contract is part of [[List of Google services and tools#Book Search|Google Print]]'s effort to digitize millions of books and make the full text searchable.  There are claims that it is a violation of copyright laws to use copyrighted material for profit by placing search ads beside the search results of these digitized books.  Also, Google is setting a new precedent by making digital copies of copyrighted material on a wide scale without explicit permission from copyright holders.  Meanwhile, Google claims that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.  The contract between Google and the U. of Michigan does make it clear that Google will provide only excerpts of copyright text in a search. The contract says that it will comply with &quot;[[fair use]]&quot;, an exemption in copyright law that allows people to reproduce portions of text of copyrighted material for research purposes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has also been criticized for allowing gangs of cyberstalkers and defamation leagues based in unmoderated Usenet news groups to use [http://www.fireflysun.com/book/Google_PUBLIC.php Google as a defamation delivery device]. By indexing Usenet news group messages (AKA Google Groups) directly to its Web Search, and by categorically denying requests by complainants to edit libelous or threatening messages out of the Web and Groups archive, Google inspires and emboldens individuals and groups who want to vandalize a victim's corner of the search by front-loading the results of a search on his or her name with links to false and flattering messages and Web-based dossiers. Complainant and social psychologist Wyatt Ehrenfels disclosed evidence that Google staffers threatened to refer him to an enemies of free speech blacklist (chillingeffects.org) if he furnished a legal document that would compel Google to remove a message about him. Just what was Google defending? An off-topic flame that included unpublished residential information about him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
