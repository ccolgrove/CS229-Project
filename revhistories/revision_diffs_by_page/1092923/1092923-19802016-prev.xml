  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as [[Square root of two|&amp;amp;#8730;2]] = 1.4142135...) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control. The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo!]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. The rivalry between Microsoft and Google has been cited most often [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. The two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;desktop and online search, &lt;/span&gt;webmail and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;browsers. &lt;/span&gt;Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;a [[List_of_Google_services_and_tools#Google_Operating_System|Google operating &lt;/span&gt;system]] to directly compete with [[Microsoft &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Windows]]. &lt;/span&gt;This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. In retribution, Microsoft has been touting its new [[MSN Search]] engine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
