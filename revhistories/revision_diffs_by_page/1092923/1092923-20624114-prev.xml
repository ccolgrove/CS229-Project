In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home to a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google received a big break in [[1999]] when one of the most popular search engines, [[Altavista]], relaunched itself as a user Web entry point, or portal.   This unexpected change alienated part of Altavista's user base. Google quickly outgrew its University Avenue home.  After outgrowing two subsequent sites, the company settled into a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;were &lt;/span&gt;were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design - - a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions.  This appearance, while imitating the early Altavista, had behind it Google's unique search capablities. In [[2000]], Google began selling [[advertisement]]s associated to the search [[keyword]] to produce enhanced search results for the user.  This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue which is based upon the number of &quot;hits&quot; users make upon ads.  The ads were text based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. It also only cost a very small amount per click to the websites that advertised this way. The model of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Overture Services Inc.]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml], formerly Goto.com. While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
