  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in the form of a $100,000 contribution from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], given to a corporation which did not yet exist. After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial investment of almost one million dollars. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the major investors being rival venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[October]], [[2003]], while discussing a possible [[IPO]] (Initial Public Offering of shares), [[Microsoft]] approached the company about a possible partnership or [[merger]]. However, no such deal ever materialized. In [[January]], [[2004]], Google announced the hiring of [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group]] to arrange an IPO. The IPO was projected to raise as much as [[United States Dollar|$]]4 billion. After some initial stumbles, Google's IPO took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;19,605,052 &lt;/span&gt;[[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders. The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control. The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. [[Yahoo!]], a competitor of Google, also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
