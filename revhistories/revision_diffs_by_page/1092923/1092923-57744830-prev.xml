  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has a tradition of creating [[April Fool's Day]] jokes such as [[Google's hoaxes#2000: Google MentalPlex|Google MentalPlex]], which featured the use of mental power to search the web. In 2002, they claimed that [[pigeons]] were the [[Google's hoaxes#2002: Pigeon Rank|secret]] behind their growing [[search engine]]. In 2004, it featured [[Google's hoaxes#2004: Google Lunar/Copernicus Center|Google Lunar]], which featured jobs on the [[moon]], and in 2005, a [[fiction|fictitious]] brain-boosting drink, termed [[Google's hoaxes#2005: Google Gulp|Google Gulp]], was announced. In 2006, they came up with [http://www.google.com/romance/ Google Romance]. One can find other pranks hidden between Google's pages. Additionally, in the languages list one can find the [http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/ Bork! Bork! Bork!] version, imitating the [[Muppet Show]]'s [[Swedish Chef]]. They also offer versions in [[Pig Latin]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Klingon]], and a [[Leet]] (''or h4x0r'') version of Google. Some people thought the announcement of [[Gmail]] in 2004 around April Fool's Day (as well as the doubling of Gmail's storage space to two gigabytes in 2005) was a joke.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
