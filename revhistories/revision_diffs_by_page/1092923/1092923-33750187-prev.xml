  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's central [[PageRank]] system has been criticized. Some, such as [[Daniel Brandt]], &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;calling &lt;/span&gt;it &quot;undemocratic&quot;. Common arguments are that the system is unfairly biased towards large web sites, and that the criteria for a page's importance are not subject to [[peer review]]. It must be stated in Google's defense that PageRank is a fully automated system which is impartial insofar as it knows no personal bias.  However, it must also be stated that Google's system relies on human oversight, and use of company names on Adwords, or deletion of critical sites from Google results (for example, sites critical of [[Scientology]]), is decided by individual human beings according to company policy.  It remains unclear whether any process could assert the importance of a page in a way that would draw less criticism than the current PageRank system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
