  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name &quot;Google&quot; is a play on the word ''[[googol]]'', which was coined by [[Milton Sirotta]], nephew of [[United States|U.S.]] [[mathematician]] [[Edward Kasner]] in [[1938]], to refer to the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the Web. As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot; - a [[googolplex]] being 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the HQ being a [[complex]] of buildings (and ''cf'' [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While in college, Brin and Page needed an Angel Investor to help push the company along.  They contacted Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the founders of [[Sun Microsystems]].  After a quick demo, &quot;He (Bechtolsheim) had to run off somewhere, so he said, 'Instead of us discussing all the details, why don't I just write you a check?' It was made out to Google Inc. and was for $100,000.&quot; says [http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Sergey], at that time the company had not been named 'Google Inc' and the check &quot;sat in Larry's desk drawer for a couple of weeks while he and Sergey scrambled to set up a corporation and locate other funders.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in the form of a $100,000 check from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], made out to a corporation which didn't yet exist. After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial investment of almost $1 million. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the &lt;/span&gt;major investors &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;being rival &lt;/span&gt;venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
