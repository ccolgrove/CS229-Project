  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While Google is the #1 search engine, the company struggles to keep up with rivals such as the well known Yahoo. Although Google and Yahoo differ greatly in the services they offer, Google is trying to redefine itself from an internet search company to an internet media company, similar to Yahoo. Google is trying to become a jack of all trades for the internet. They are foraying into other businesses which other companies have recently dominated. On June 21st 2005 Google announced it has plans to release a pay service and a classified ads service, to rival companies like Ebay [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/20/business/google.php].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the Q3 2005 Google Confference Call, Eric Schmidt said, &quot;We don't do the same thing as every else does. And so if you try to predict our product strategy by simply saying well so and so has this and Google will do the same thing, it's almost always the wrong answer. We look at markets as they exist and we assume they are pretty well served by their existing players. We try to see new problems and new markets using the technology that others use and we build.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
