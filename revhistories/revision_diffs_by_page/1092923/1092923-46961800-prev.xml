Videos offered via this service are protected using Google's own [[Digital rights management]] system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[2004]], Google launched its own web-based email service, known as [[Gmail]]. Gmail &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;primarily &lt;/span&gt;features improved spam filtering technology, combined with the capability to use Google search technology on individual email &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;messages. The service generates revenue by displaying advertisements from the [[AdWords]] service, which caused some controversy by some privacy advocates that were concerned that the company was looking at everyone's emails. Though Google maintains that no humans are interactively searching for and looking at specific &lt;/span&gt;messages. Gmail &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;somewhat revolutionized &lt;/span&gt;the free, web-based email market &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;as they &lt;/span&gt;initially &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;offered &lt;/span&gt;1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of email storage, prompting competitors [[Yahoo!]] and [[Hotmail]] to increase their storage quotas considerably. Google has since expanded &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;their &lt;/span&gt;mail quota (and continues to expand it); as of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[March]], &lt;/span&gt;[[2006]], &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;their &lt;/span&gt;quota was &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;just under 3.0 &lt;/span&gt;GB.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
