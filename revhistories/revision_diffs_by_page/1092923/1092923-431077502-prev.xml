  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the disadvantages and criticisms of this program is Google's inability to combat [[click fraud]], when a person or automated script &quot;clicks&quot; on advertisements without being interested in the product, which causes that advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claim that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were in fact fraudulent or invalid.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mills, Elinor. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/Google-to-offer-advertisers-click-fraud-stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats].&quot; ''[http://www.cnet.com/ c net].''
