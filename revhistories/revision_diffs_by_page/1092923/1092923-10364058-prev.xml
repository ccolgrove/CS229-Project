  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization has risen to $50 billion as the stock price has doubled. On August 19 2004 the number of [[shares outstanding]] was 172.85 million while the &quot;[[free float]]&quot; was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by insiders). In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by [[insiders]] which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A number of organizations (most controversially the [[Church of Scientology]]) have used the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to demand that Google remove references to allegedly [[copyright]]ed material on other sites. Google typically handles this by removing the link as requested and including a link to the complaint in the search results. There have also been complaints that the &quot;Google cache&quot; feature violates copyright. However, the consensus seems to be that caching is a normal part of the functionality of the web, and that [[HTTP]] provides adequate mechanisms for requesting that caching be disabled (which Google respects; it also honors the [[robots.txt]] file which is a mechanism to allow the owners of a site to request that part or all of their site not be included in search engine listings).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
