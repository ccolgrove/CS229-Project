  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The size of Google's search system is presently unknown; the best estimates place the total number of the companies servers at 450,000, spread over twenty five locations throughout the world, including major [[network operations center|operations centers]] in [[Ireland]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Google is also in the process of constructing a major operations center in [[The Dallas, Oregon]], on the banks of the [[Columbia River]]. The site, also referred to by the media as ''Project 02'', was chosen due to the availability of inexpensive [[hydroelectric power]] and a large surplus of [[fiber optic]] cable, left over from the dot com boom of the late 1990s. The computing center is estimated to be as large as two [[American football|football fields]], and it has created hundreds of construction jobs, causing local real estate prices to increase 40%. Upon completion, the center is expected to create 60 to 200 permanent jobs in the town of 12,000 people.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;Project02&quot;&amp;gt;Markoff, John; Hansell, Saul. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ei=5088&amp;amp;en=c96a72bbc5f90a47&amp;amp;ex=1307937600&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=print Hiding in Plain Sight, Google Seeks More Power].&quot; ''[[New York Times]].''
