  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Microsoft's name (which was originally [[CamelCase|bicapitalized]] MicroSoft) is a [[blend (linguistics)|blend]] of &quot;microcomputer software&quot;, and is often abbreviated as ''MS''. The company was founded in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] on [[April 4]], [[1975]] by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] to develop and sell [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]]s for the [[Altair 8800]]. After the market saw a flood of [[IBM PC]] clones in the mid-1980s, Microsoft used its new position, which it gained in part due to a contract from [[IBM]], to dominate the home computer operating system market with [[MS-DOS]]. The company later released an [[IPO|initial public offering (IPO)]] in the [[stock market]], which netted several of its employees millions of dollars due to the ensuing rise of the stock price. The price of the stock continued its rise steadily into the early 2000s. In Microsoft Windows, the company was selling what would become the most widely used operating system in the world, which was originally an add-on for MS-DOS; Microsoft continued to push into multiple markets, such as computer hardware and television. In addition, Microsoft has historically given customer support over [[Usenet]] newsgroups and the [[World Wide Web]], and awards [[Microsoft MVP]] status to volunteers who are deemed helpful in assisting the company's customers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
