  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in early [[1996]] by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students who developed the theory that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between websites would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed '''BackRub''' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant webpages must be the most relevant ones, Page and Brin decided to test their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. They formally founded their company, '''Google Inc.''', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;the somewhat notorious &lt;/span&gt;[[165 University &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Ave., Palo Alto, California]] office location, before &lt;/span&gt;moving to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;the &quot;Googleplex&quot; &lt;/span&gt;later that year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine gained a following among [[Internet]] users for its simple, clean design and relevant search results. [[Advertisement]]s were sold by the [[keyword]] so that they would be more relevant to the end user, and the ads were text-based in order to keep page design uncluttered and fast-loading. The concept of selling Keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Overture]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml], formerly Goto.com. While many of its [[dot-com]] siblings went under, Google quietly rose in stature while turning a profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
