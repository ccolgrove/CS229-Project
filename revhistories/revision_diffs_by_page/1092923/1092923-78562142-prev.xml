Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University]] website with the domain ''google.stanford.edu''.

After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company settled into their current home in a complex of buildings in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, in 2003.  The complex has since become known as the [[Googleplex]] (a play on the word [[googolplex]], a 1 followed by a googol of zeros). [[Silicon Graphics]] leased the buildings to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Google.  I am god, if you dont listen to me you will die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions. This appearance imitated [[AltaVista]]'s, but incorporated Google's unique search capabilities. In 2000, Google began selling [[advertising|advertisement]]s associated with search [[keyword (internet search)|keyword]]s. This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of hits users make upon ads. The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and clickthroughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com]] (later renamed Overture, then Yahoo! Search Marketing).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Yahoo! Search Marketing Website].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originally, typical salaries at Google were considered to be quite low by industry standards. For example, some [[system administrator]]s earned no more than $33,000 &amp;amp;mdash; while $40,000 at that time was considered to be low for the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] job market. Nevertheless, Google's excellent stock performance following the IPO has enabled these early employees to be competitively compensated by participation in the corporation's remarkable equity growth. In 2005, Google has implemented other employee incentives such as the [[Google Founders' Award]], in addition to offering higher salaries to new employees. Google's workplace amenities, culture, global popularity, and strong brand recognition have also attracted potential applicants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
