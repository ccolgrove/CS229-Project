Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidates at &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Princeton &lt;/span&gt;University|Stanford]] who developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small searchengine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The domain www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally founded their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google got a big break in 1999 when [[Altavista]], the most popular searchengine among knowledgeable users, relaunched as a portal and alienated those users.  Google quickly outgrew the University Avenue site.  After further outgrowing two other sites, the company settled on a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in 2003.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine gained a following among [[Internet]] users for its simple, clean design (imitating the early Altavista) and relevant search results. In [[2000]], Google had begun selling [[advertisement]]s by the [[keyword]] so that they would be more relevant to the end user. The ads were text-based in order to keep page design uncluttered and fast-loading. The concept of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Overture]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml], formerly Goto.com. While many of its [[dot-com]] siblings went under, Google quietly rose in stature while turning a profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
