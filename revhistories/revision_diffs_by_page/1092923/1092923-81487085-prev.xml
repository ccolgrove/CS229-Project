  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2004, Google and Keyhole provided [[Google Earth]], a downloadable program that allows the user to zoom into nearly any spot on the earth, close enough to make out cars, and in some cases, people. The technology comes with hundreds of add-ons, like &quot;Crime rate&quot;, to see the crime rate of the city you are zoomed in on, or &quot;3D buildings&quot;, to create 3D models of the towers and buildings of larger cities. There are three available versions, &quot;free edition&quot;, &quot;plus&quot;, and &quot;pro&quot;. The cost of plus as of October 2006 is $20.00US and Pro for $400. Google has also released new software that allows users to creat building and houses that can then be added to Google Earth (called google sketchup).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
