The mirror search site [[elgooG]] has been used by Chinese citizens to get around blocked content. This complete ban is currently lifted. However, the government remains active in filtering Internet content. In October 2005, Blogger and access to the Google Cache were made available in China; however, in December 2005, some Chinese users of Blogger reported that their access to the site was once again restricted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In January 2006 Google affirmed its intent to filter certain keywords given to it by the Chinese government. The restrictions will apply to thousands of terms and websites.[http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/01/24/D8FBCF686.html] The censored content will appear on a website called google.cn. Google was heavily criticized for the move, yet it claims it is necessary to keep the Chinese government from blocking Google entirely. The company does not plan to give the government information about the users who search for blocked content, and will inform users of restricted categories. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4647398.stm] Google states on its help pages that it does not censor content, but it does block pages as demanded for in certain jurisdictions, such as [[DMCA]] requests in the United States. Most Chinese Internet users did not express much concern about Google's choice, with one blogger saying that censorship is a fact of life in China and Google could not have done any better.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4650158.stm]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
