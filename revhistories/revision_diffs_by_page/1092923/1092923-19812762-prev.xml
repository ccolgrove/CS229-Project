  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. The rivalry between Microsoft and Google has been cited most often [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. The two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail ([[Gmail]] vs. [[Hotmail]]), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's [[Virtual Earth]] competes with [[Google Maps]]). Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing its own [[operating system]] to directly compete with [[Microsoft Windows]], as well as its own browser, rumors of which are fueled by the fact that Google is the owner of the [[domain name]] &quot;gbrowser.com&quot;. This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;In retribution, &lt;/span&gt;Microsoft has been touting its new [[MSN Search]] &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is a [[multinational corporation]], having offices in over a dozen countries [http://www.google.ie/intl/en/corporate/address.html].  In order to comply with the varying laws of these countries, several versions of Google restrict very specific keyword searches. According to [[US|American]] law, any copyright owner can require material to be removed via the [[DMCA|Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], whereas under [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] law, for example, [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]] are illegal. Google complies with these laws by banning keyword searches related to these terms. The [[People's Republic of China]], whose [[human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]] has been widely criticized by the international community, has in the past restricted citizen access to popular search engines such as [[Altavista]], [[Yahoo!]], and Google. The mirror search site [[Elgoog|elgooG]] has been used by Chinese citizens to get around blocked content. This complete ban is currently lifted. However, the government remains active in filtering Internet content.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
