  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has also developed several desktop applications, including [[Google Earth]], an interactive mapping program powered by satellite and aerial imagery that covers the vast majority of the planet. Google Earth is generally considered to be remarkably accurate and extremely detailed. Many major cities have such detailed images that one can zoom in close enough to see vehicles and pedestrians clearly. Consequently, there have been some concerns about national security &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;implications. Specifically, some countries and militaries contend &lt;/span&gt;the software can be used to pinpoint with near-precision accuracy the physical location of critical infrastructure, commercial and residential buildings, bases, government agencies, and so on.
