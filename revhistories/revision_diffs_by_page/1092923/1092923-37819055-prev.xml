  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization has risen greatly and the stock price has more than quadrupled. On [[August 19]], [[2004]] the number of [[shares outstanding]] was 172.85 million while the &quot;[[Float (finance)|free float]]&quot; was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by [[insider]]s). In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by insiders which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The actual voting power of the insiders is much higher, however, as Google has a dual class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one.  Page says in the [[prospectus]] that Google has &quot;a dual class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.&quot;  The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

And so if you try to predict our product strategy by simply saying well so and so has this and Google will do the same thing, it's almost always the wrong answer. We look at markets as they exist and we assume they are pretty well served by their existing players. We try to see new problems and new markets using the technology that others use and we build.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
