  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some have pointed out the privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of internet users' searches, and how under existing US law, Google would be required to hand over all such information to the US government.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some users believe the processing of email message content by Google's [[GMail]] service goes beyond proper use. The point is often made that people without GMail accounts, who have not agreed to the GMail terms of service, but send email to GMail users have their correspondence analyzed without permission. Google claims that mail sent to or from GMail is never read by a human being beyond the account holder, and is only used to improve relevance of advertisements. Other popular email services such as [[Hotmail]] also scan incoming email to try to determine whether it is unsolicited email.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
