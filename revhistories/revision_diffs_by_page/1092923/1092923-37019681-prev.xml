  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name &quot;Google&quot; is a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;reference to &lt;/span&gt;the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;word &lt;/span&gt;&quot;[[googol]],&quot; the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros. Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission, which is, &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot; As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as, &quot;the [[Googleplex]]&quot; (a [[googolplex]] is a 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the ''-plex'' refers to a [[complex]] of buildings, such as [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
