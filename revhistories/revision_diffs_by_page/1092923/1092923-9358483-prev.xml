  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In January [[2004]], Google announced the hiring of [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group]] to arrange an IPO. That IPO (one of the most anticipated in history) was projected to raise as much as $4 billion. According to a banker involved in the transaction, the deal would yield an estimated $12 billion [[market capitalization]] for Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 29]], [[2004]], Google filed an [[S-1 form]] with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] for an [[IPO]] to raise as much as [[United States dollar|USD]] $2,718,281,828 (with a touch of [[e (mathematical constant)#Humorous_use_of_e|mathematical &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;humor]] in the exact amount). &lt;/span&gt;The filing revealed that Google turned a profit every year since [[2001]] and earned a profit of $105.6 million on revenues of $961.8 million during [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[May 2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They choose the unconvetional way of allocation the initial offering through an auction (and specifically a &quot;[[dutch &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;auction]]&quot;). So &lt;/span&gt;that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;to be &lt;/span&gt;allowed to participate in an &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;IPO were hoewever in the $100,000 league. But if the broker requirements weren't so high anyone could theoretically have been able to buy as little as one share of the first offering. &lt;/span&gt;In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;offering. But &lt;/span&gt;the process didn't run into any technical &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;difficulties, &lt;/span&gt;or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;control.  &lt;/span&gt;The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo!]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was was listed on the [[Nasdaq]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization has risen to $50 billion as the stock price has doubled. On August 19 2004 the number of [[shares outstanding]] was 172.85 million while the &quot;[[free float]]&quot; was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by insiders). In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by [[insiders]] which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
