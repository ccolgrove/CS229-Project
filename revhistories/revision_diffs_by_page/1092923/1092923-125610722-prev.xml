  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since 2001, Google has acquired several small start-up companies, often consisting of innovative teams and products. One of the earlier companies that Google bought was [[Pyra Labs]]. They were the creators of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Blogger]], &lt;/span&gt;a weblog publishing platform, first launched in 1999. This acquisition led to many premium features becoming free. Pyra Labs was originally formed by [[Evan Williams]], yet he left Google in 2004. In early 2006, Google acquired Upstartle, a company responsible for the online word processor, Writely. The technology in this product was used by Google to eventually create [[Google Docs &amp;amp; Spreadsheets]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
