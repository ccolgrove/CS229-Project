  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in the form of a $100,000 contribution from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], given to a corporation which didn't yet exist. After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial investment of almost $1 million. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the major investors being rival venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

In January 2004, Google announced the hiring of [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group]] to arrange an IPO. That IPO (one of the most anticipated in history) was projected to raise as much as $4 billion. According to a banker involved in the transaction, the deal would yield an estimated $12 billion [[market capitalization]] for Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
