  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name &quot;Google&quot; is a play on the word &quot;[[Googol]]&quot;, which was coined by [[Milton Sirotta]], nine-year-old nephew of [[United States|U.S.]] [[mathematician]] [[Edward Kasner]] in [[1938]], to refer to the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the Web. As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot; &amp;amp;mdash; a [[googolplex]] being 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the HQ being a [[complex]] of buildings (cf. [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Adam's popular work has often been plundered for geek-usable terms (the Babel fish being another example). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name has also been interpreted as a merging of the words &quot;Go ogle&quot;, though this is widely accepted to be coincidental. The term appears in [[James Joyce]]'s [[Finnegans Wake]]: &quot;who thought him a Fonar all, feastking of shellies by googling Lovvey&quot; [231.12]. To &quot;throw a googly&quot; means to ask  a difficult or unanswerable question in British slang, a [[googly]] being a tricky ball in the game of [[cricket]]. ''Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1972) allows the verb &quot;to google&quot; from this, and the phrase has come to be synonymous with &quot;to search for on the Internet&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
