  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 1]], [[2004]], Google announced its own free [[webmail]] service, [[Gmail]], which would provide users with 1000 [[Megabyte|megabytes]] of storage for their mailboxes and would generate revenue by displaying advertisements from the AdWords service based on words in users' e-mail messages. Owing to [[April Fool's Day]], however, the company's press release was greeted with much skepticism in the technology world. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice-president of products, re-assured [[BBC News]] by saying &quot;We are very serious about Gmail.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The service is set to allow up to 1000 MB of storage space. When Gmail was announced, this was vastly more than that of most other free [[webmail]] providers&amp;amp;mdash;for example, [[Microsoft]]'s [[Hotmail]] only offered 2 MB, and [[Yahoo!]]'s Mail service offered 4 MB. In response to Gmail, these limits have been upgraded, to 250 MB for Hotmail and 100 MB for Yahoo. Other webmail providers have followed suit, some of them now offering larger storage than Gmail.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

This means that people will be able  to read their mail through a POP3 compatible e-mail client like [[Outlook Express]]. Most other online email services charge for a POP3 connectivity and message forwarding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As of [[August 25]], [[2004]], the service was being tested internally. It is not known when the service will be made available to the public. However, the service is available to [[Blogger]] users and by invitation from current [[Gmail]] users. However, the invites system has led to Gmail invites being exchanged for cash and goods through websites like [http://www.gmailswap.com/ Gmail swap], making Google change its policy on invites by disallowing cash exchanges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There has been a great deal of criticism regarding Gmail's privacy policy.[http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/privacy.html] Much of the controversy involved the clause &quot;residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of your account.&quot; Many believed that this meant that Google would intentionally archive copies of deleted mail forever. Google later stated that they will &quot;make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practical.&quot; Most of the criticism, however, was against Google's plans to add context-sensitive advertisements to e-mails by automatically scanning them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The search engine let's you search for images, products ([[Froogle]]), news, and the [[usenet]] archive. It uses a proprietary [[PageRank]] system and 253,088 [[Gigahertz|GHz]] of processing power to deliver the most relevant search results.
