  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some have pointed out the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users' searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], or any other government of a country which Google serves.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It has been claimed that Google infringes the privacy of visitors by uniquely identifying them using [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] which are used to track Web users' search history.  The cookies possess notably distant expiration dates and it is claimed users' searches are recorded without permission for advertising purposes. In response Google claims cookies are necessary to maintain user preferences between sessions and offer other search features. The use of cookies with such distant expiration dates is not &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;very &lt;/span&gt;uncommon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some users believe the processing of email message content by Google's [[Gmail]] service goes beyond proper use. The point is often made that people without Gmail accounts, who have not agreed to the Gmail terms of service, but send email to Gmail users have their correspondence analyzed without permission. Google claims that mail sent to or from Gmail is never read by a human being beyond the account holder, and is only used to improve relevance of advertisements. Other popular email services such as [[Hotmail]] also scan incoming email to try to determine whether it is unsolicited spam email (which Gmail also does). Chris Hoofnagle, associate director of the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] in Washington, DC warned that &quot;As courts become more frequent integrators of electronic records, there is a greater risk of Google ... becoming a serious privacy threat.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
