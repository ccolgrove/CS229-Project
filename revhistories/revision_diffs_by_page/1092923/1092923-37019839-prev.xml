  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name &quot;Google&quot; is a spelling mistake of the term &quot;[[googol]],&quot; the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros. When the company was intitially founded, Page and Brin found (to their suprise) that the domain google.com was available. Googol.com was, and still is, owned by Tim Beauchamp, a Silicon Valley software egineer. Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission, which is, &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot; As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as, &quot;the [[Googleplex]]&quot; (a [[googolplex]] is a 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the ''-plex'' refers to a [[complex]] of buildings, such as [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
