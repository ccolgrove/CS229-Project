  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 1]], [[2004]], Google announced its own free [[webmail]] service, Gmail, which would provide users with 1000 [[Megabyte|megabytes]] of storage for their mailboxes and would generate revenue by displaying advertisements from the AdWords service based on words in users' e-mail messages. Owing to [[April Fool's Day]], however, the company's press release was greeted with much skepticism in the technology world. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice-president of products, re-assured [[BBC News]] by saying &quot;We are very serious about Gmail.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Owing to [[April Fool's Day]], however, the company's press release was greeted with much skepticism in the technology world. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice-president of products, re-assured [[BBC News]] by saying &quot;We are very serious about Gmail.&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;When Gmail was announced, the storage space available was vastly more than that of  most other free [[webmail]] providers&amp;amp;mdash;for example, [[Microsoft]]'s [[Hotmail]] only offered 2 MB, and [[Yahoo!]]'s Mail service offered 4 MB. In response to Gmail, these limits have been upgraded, to 250 MB. There has been a great deal of criticism regarding Gmail's privacy policy. Most of the criticism was over Google's plans to add context-sensitive advertisements to e-mails by automatically scanning them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The service is set to allow up to 1000 [[Megabyte|MB]] of storage space. When Gmail was announced, this was vastly more than that of most other free [[webmail]] providers&amp;amp;mdash;for example, [[Microsoft]]'s [[Hotmail]] only offered 2 MB, and [[Yahoo!]]'s Mail service offered 4 MB. In response to Gmail, these limits have been upgraded, to 250 MB. Other Web mail providers have followed suit, some of them now offering larger storage than Gmail. On [[November 13]], [[2004]] Google anounced that Gmail will be [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]] compatible and have e-mail forwarding for no extra charge. This means that people will be able  to read their mail through a POP3 compatible e-mail client like [[Outlook Express]]. Most other online email services charge for a POP3 connectivity and message forwarding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As of [[August 25]], [[2004]], the service was being tested internally. It is not known when the service will be made available to the public. However, the service is available to [[Blogger]] users and by invitation from current [[Gmail]] users. However, the invites system has led to Gmail invites being exchanged for cash and goods through Web sites like [http://www.gmailswap.com/ Gmail swap], making Google change its policy on invites by disallowing cash exchanges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There has been a great deal of criticism regarding Gmail's privacy policy.[http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/privacy.html] Much of the controversy involved the clause &quot;residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of your account.&quot; Many believed that this meant that Google would intentionally archive copies of deleted mail forever. Google later stated that they will &quot;make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practical.&quot; Most of the criticism, however, was against Google's plans to add context-sensitive advertisements to e-mails by automatically scanning them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
