  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the Web. As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot; - a [[googolplex]] being 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the HQ being a [[complex]] of buildings (and ''cf'' [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name has also been interpreted as a merging of the words 'Go ogle', though this is widely accepted to be coincidental. To &quot;throw a googly&quot; means to ask  a difficult or unanswerable question in British slang, a googly being a tricky ball in the game of cricket. ''Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1972) allows the verb &quot;to google&quot; from &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Google&quot; is also the surname of the title character from a popular comic strip, [[Barney Google]], that was first published in 1919. He was known for having &quot;Goo-Goo-Googley Eyes.&quot; The word &quot;google&quot; was also used in the 1927 Little Rascals silent film &quot;Dog Heaven&quot; to refer to having a drink of water. In that sense it was likely a modification of &quot;[[gurgle]].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
