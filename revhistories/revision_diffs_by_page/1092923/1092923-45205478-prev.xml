  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is widely rumored that Google stole their search technology from FOOKY.com in the late 1990's.  While Larry and Sergey went on to be multi billionaires, Ed Dunn of FOOKY lived a penniless life trying to get people to use an antiquated site with no form tags.  Mr. Dunn explains this is just another example of the white man stealing for the over creative black man.  Where would Google really be without FOOKY?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name &quot;Google&quot; is a play on the word &quot;[[googol]],&quot; which refers to the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros. As a further play on this, Google's headquarters, located in California, are referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot; &amp;amp;mdash; a [[googolplex]] being 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the HQ being a [[complex]] of buildings (cf. [[movie theater|multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
