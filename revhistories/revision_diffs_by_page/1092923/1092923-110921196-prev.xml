  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions. This appearance imitated [[AltaVista]]'s, but incorporated Google's unique search capabilities. In 2000, Google began selling [[advertising|advertisements]] associated with search [[keyword (internet search)|keywords]]. This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of hits users make upon ads. The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and clickthroughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com]] (later renamed Overture Services, before being acquired by [[Yahoo!]] and rebranded as [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]]). While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
