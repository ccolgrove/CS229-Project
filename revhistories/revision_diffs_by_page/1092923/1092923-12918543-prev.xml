The domain www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally founded their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google quickly outgrew the University Avenue site.  After further outgrowing two other sites, the company settled on a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in 2003.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
