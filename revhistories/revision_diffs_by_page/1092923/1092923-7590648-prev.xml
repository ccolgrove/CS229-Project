  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[2003]], Google acquired the [[Pyra Labs]] and [[Blogger]] services. Formerly premium features that needed to be paid for were made available for free by Google. The tool, Blogger, is a service to make [[weblog]] publishing easier. The user does not have to write any code or worry about installing server software or scripts. Nevertheless, the user can influence the design of his blog freely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 1]], [[2004]], Google announced its own free [[webmail]] service, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Gmail]], &lt;/span&gt;which would provide users with 1000 [[Megabyte|megabytes]] of storage for their mailboxes and would generate revenue by displaying advertisements from the AdWords service based on words in users' e-mail messages. Owing to [[April Fool's Day]], however, the company's press release was greeted with much skepticism in the technology world. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice-president of products, re-assured [[BBC News]] by saying &quot;We are very serious about Gmail.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The service is set to allow up to 1000 [[Megabyte|MB]] of storage space. When Gmail was announced, this was vastly more than that of most other free [[webmail]] providers&amp;amp;mdash;for example, [[Microsoft]]'s [[Hotmail]] only offered 2 MB, and [[Yahoo!]]'s Mail service offered 4 MB. In response to Gmail, these limits have been upgraded, to 250 MB. Other webmail providers have followed suit, some of them now offering larger storage than Gmail. On [[November 13]], [[2004]] Google anounced that Gmail will be [[POP3]] compatible and have e-mail forwarding for no extra charge. This means that people will be able  to read their mail through a POP3 compatible e-mail client like [[Outlook Express]]. Most other online email services charge for a POP3 connectivity and message forwarding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
