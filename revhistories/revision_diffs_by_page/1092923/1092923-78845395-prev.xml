  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2004, Google launched its own free web-based email service, known as [[Gmail]]. Gmail features improved spam filtering technology, combined with the capability to use Google search technology on individual email messages. Gmail shook up the free, web-based email market by initially offering 1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of email storage, prompting competitors [[Yahoo!]] and [[Hotmail]] to increase their storage quotas considerably. Google has since expanded Gmail's mail quota (and continues to expand it); as of September, 2006, the quota was over 2.76 GB. The service generates revenue by displaying advertisements from the [[AdWords]] service that are tailored to the content of the email messages displayed on screen. This feature has proven controversial, with some privacy advocates expressing concern that the company was reading individual emails. Google maintains, however, that the process is fully automated and that no humans read the content of users' messages.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
