  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[September 20]], 2005, the Authors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, with a children's book author, and a former Poet Laureate of the United States,  filed a class action suit in federal court in Manhattan against Google over its unauthorized scanning and copying of books through its Google Library program. The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction that will prevent the company from continuing their very ambitious digitization project.  Arguments in the case will hinge around the interpretation of [[Fair use#Fair use under United States law|the four factors of Fair Use]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
