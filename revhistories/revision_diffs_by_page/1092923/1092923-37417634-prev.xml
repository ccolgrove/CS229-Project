When the company was intitially founded, Page and Brin found (to their suprise) that the domain google.com was available. Googol.com was, and still is, owned by Tim Beauchamp, a Silicon Valley software engineer. Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission, which is, &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot; As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as, &quot;the [[Googleplex]]&quot; (a [[googolplex]] is a 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the ''-plex'' refers to a [[complex]] of buildings, such as [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
