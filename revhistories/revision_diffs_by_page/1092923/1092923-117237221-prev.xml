  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As it has grown, Google has found itself the focus of several controversies related to its business practices and services. For example, [[Google Book Search|Google Book Search's]] effort to digitize millions of books and make the full text searchable has led to [[copyright]] disputes with the [[Authors Guild]]. Google's cooperation with the governments of [[China]], and to a lesser extent [[France]] and [[Germany]] (regarding [[Holocaust denial]]) to filter search results in accordance to regional laws and regulations has led to claims of [[Censorship by Google|censorship]]. Google's persistent [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] and other information collection practices have led to concerns over user [[Google and privacy issues|privacy]]. A number of governments have raised concerns about the security risks posed by geographic details provided by [[Google Earth|Google Earth's]] satellite imaging.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;satimgs&quot;/&amp;gt; Google has also been criticized by advertisers regarding its inability to combat [[click fraud]], when a person or automated script is used to generate a charge on an advertisement without really having an interest in the product. Industry reports in [[2006]] claim that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were in fact fraudulent or invalid.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mills, Elinor. &quot;[http://news.com.com/Google+to+offer+advertisers+click+fraud+stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats].&quot; ''[http://www.cnet.com/ c net].''
