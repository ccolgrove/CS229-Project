  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]].    19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share.  Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google.  The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control.  The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Yahoo]] &lt;/span&gt;also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
