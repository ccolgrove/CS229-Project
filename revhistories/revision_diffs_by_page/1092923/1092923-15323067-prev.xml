  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[March 2005]], [[Agence France Presse]] (AFP) sued Google for $17.5 million, alleging that [[Google News]] infringed on its copyright because &quot;Google includes AFP&amp;amp;#8217;s photos, stories and news headlines on Google News without permission from Agence France Presse.&quot; [http://news.dcealumni.com/376/20305-googles-news-sued-for-infringing-agence-france-presse-copyrighted-work/]   It was also alleged that Google ignored a [[cease and desist]] order, though Google counters that it has opt-out procedures which AFP could have followed but did not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is possible that AFP will make additional arguments in court that it has not yet made in public, but currently, many pundits are confused by the decision to sue [http://weblog.physorg.com/news1362.html][http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=3538][http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/2080.html] because Google does not display the full article &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;or your mother &lt;/span&gt;on its site, provides a link to one of AFP's 600 online clients such as [[Channel News Asia]] (which presumably benefits AFP because more people view the article and advertising), and because the articles are available via the providers' websites regardless of Google's actions.  It was argued that had AFP wanted to prevent free use of its articles, it should have asked its providers to require subscriptions rather than suing Google.  Additionally, &quot;in 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that Web sites may reproduce and post 'thumbnail' or downsized versions of copyrighted photographs,&quot; so Google News' [[thumbnail]]s are likely legal. [http://news.dcealumni.com/376/20305-googles-news-sued-for-infringing-agence-france-presse-copyrighted-work/]  Still, AFP argues that the headline and first sentence of an article constitutes the &quot;heart&quot; of the work and that reproducing it is copyright infringement.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
