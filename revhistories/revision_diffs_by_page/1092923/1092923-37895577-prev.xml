  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Analysts speculate that Google's response to Yahoo! will be to continue to make technical and visual enhancements to personalized searches, using the personal data that is gathering from [[Orkut]], [[Gmail]], and [[Froogle]] to produce unique results based on the user. Frequently, new Google enhancements or products appear in its inventory.  Products and [[demo]]s [http://labs.google.com/ Google Labs], the experimental section of Google.com help Google maximize its relationships with its users by including them in the beta development, design and testing stages of new products and enhancements of already existing ones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name &quot;Google&quot; is a play on the word &quot;[[Googol]]&quot;, which was coined by [[Milton Sirotta]], nine-year-old nephew of [[United States|U.S.]] [[mathematician]] [[Edward Kasner]] in [[1938]], to refer to the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros. As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot; &amp;amp;mdash; a [[googolplex]] being 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the HQ being a [[complex]] of buildings (cf. [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc). &amp;lt;!--if you are going to delete this please say why in your comment, thanks. --&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in the form of a $100,000 contribution from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], given to a corporation which didn't yet exist. After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial investment of almost $1 million. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the major investors being rival venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
