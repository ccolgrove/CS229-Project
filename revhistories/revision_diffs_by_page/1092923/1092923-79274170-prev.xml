  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2006 Google moved into 311,000 square feet of office space in the second-largest building in [[New York City]], at 111 Eighth Ave in Manhattan. The location is one of the most important &quot;telecom hotels&quot; in the world, a giant networking facility adjascent to the Hudson Street/Ninth Avenue fiber highway, one of the most critical Internet arteries in the world that connects the eastern United States with 430 Gbit/s of international internet capacity terminates. It is Google's largest engineering complex outside of its headquarters. Google's large investment in its New York operations, which developed Maps, Spreadsheets, Checkout, Blog search, and Mobile search, has spurred much speculation that Google is planning to build a massive data center in which Google could connect its servers directly into the fiber-optic communications network at 111 Eighth Ave., allowing the company to bypass networks owned and operated by the phone companies. Google's engineering director in New York, Craig Nevill-Manning, denies this and maintains the company seeks to exploit the software engineering talent in New York City.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
