  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As it has grown, Google has found itself the focus of several controversies related to its business practices and services. For example, [[Google Book Search]]'s effort to digitize millions of books and make the full text searchable has led to [[copyright]] disputes with the [[Authors Guild]]. Google's cooperation with the governments of [[People's Republic of China|China]], and to a lesser extent [[France]] and [[Germany]] (regarding [[Holocaust denial]]) to filter search results in accordance to regional laws and regulations has led to claims of [[censorship by Google|censorship]]. Google's persistent [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] and other information collection practices have led to concerns over user [[Google and privacy issues|privacy]]. A number of governments have raised concerns about the security risks posed by geographic details provided by [[Google Earth]]'s satellite imaging.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;satimgs&quot;&amp;gt;Sharma, Dinesh C. &quot;[http://news.com.com/Indian+president+rails+against+Google+Earth/2100-1028_3-5896888.html?part=rss&amp;amp;tag=5896888&amp;amp;subj=news Indian president warns against Google Earth].&quot; ''[http://www.cnet.com/ c net].''
