  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]].    19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share.  Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google.  The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control.  The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;billion.  &lt;/span&gt;Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A number of organizations (most controversially the [[Church of Scientology]]) have used the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to demand that Google remove references to allegedly [[copyright|copyrighted]] material on other sites. Google typically handles this by removing the link as requested and including a link to the complaint in the search results. There have also been complaints that the &quot;Google cache&quot; feature violates copyright. However, the consensus seems to be that caching is a normal part of the functionality of the web, and that [[HTTP]] provides adequate mechanisms for requesting that caching be disabled (which Google respects; it also honors the [[robots.txt]] file which is a mechanism to allow the owners of a site to request that part or all of their site not be included in search engine listings).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
