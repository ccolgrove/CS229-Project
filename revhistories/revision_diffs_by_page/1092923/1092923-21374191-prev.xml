  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. The rivalry between Microsoft and Google has been cited most often [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. The two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail ([[Gmail]] vs. [[Hotmail]]), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's [[Virtual Earth]] competes with [[Google Maps]]). Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing its own [[operating system]] to directly compete with [[Microsoft Windows]], as well as its own browser, rumors of which are fueled by the fact that Google is the owner of the [[domain name]] &quot;gbrowser.com&quot;. This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. Microsoft has been touting its new [[MSN Search]] engine to counter Google's competitive position. On [[August 18]] [[2005]] (one year after the initial IPO), Google announced that it would sell 14,159,265 (a mathematical joke, see [[pi]]) more shares of its stock to raise money. The move would double Google's cash stockpile to $7 billion. Google said it would use the money for &quot;acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets&quot;.
