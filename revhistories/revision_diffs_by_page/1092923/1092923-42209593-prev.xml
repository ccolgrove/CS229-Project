  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. One such example is the rivalry between Microsoft and Google [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. Microsoft has been touting its [[MSN Search]] engine to counter Google's competitive position. Furthermore, the two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail ([[Gmail]] vs. [[Hotmail]]), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's [[Windows Live Local]] competes with [[Google Earth]]). Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing its own Linux based [[operating system]] called Google OS to directly compete with [[Microsoft Windows]]. Rumors of a Google browser are fueled by the fact that Google is the owner of the [[domain name]] &quot;gbrowser.com&quot;. This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. This feud boiled over into the courts when [[Kai-Fu Lee]], a former vice-president of Microsoft, quit Microsoft to work for Google. Microsoft sued to stop his move by citing Lee's non-compete contract (he had access to much sensitive information regarding Microsoft's plans in China).
