  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is a [[multinational corporation]], having offices in over a dozen countries [http://www.google.ie/intl/en/corporate/address.html].  In order to comply with the varying laws of these countries, several versions of Google restrict very specific keyword searches. According to [[US|American]] law, any copyright owner can require material to be removed via the [[DMCA|Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], whereas under [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] law, for example, [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]] are illegal. Google complies with these laws by banning keyword searches related to these terms. The [[People's Republic of China]], whose [[human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]] has been widely criticized by the international community, has in the past restricted citizen access to popular search engines such as [[Altavista]], [[Yahoo!]], and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Google. &lt;/span&gt;The mirror search site [[Elgoog|elgooG]] has been used by Chinese citizens to get around blocked content. This complete ban is currently lifted. However, the government remains active in filtering Internet content.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The French news agency, AFP, reported that Microsoft, Yahoo! and Google have all agreed to cooperate in censoring the Internet from their China  based sites by filtering out content objectionable to the Chinese government. The list of forbidden words includes &quot;democracy,&quot; &quot;freedom,&quot; &quot;human rights,&quot; and &quot;Taiwan independence.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
