  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in January [[1996]] &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Jerome Bettis]] &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Sam Cassel]], &lt;/span&gt;two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  They developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce improved results over the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] website with the domain: 'google.stanford.edu' (see the [http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Internet Archive Wayback Machine] search for [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://google.stanford.edu http://google.stanford.edu]). The domain 'www.google.com' was registered on [[September 15]] [[1997]]. They formally incorporated their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]] [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home to a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google received a big break in [[1999]] when one of the most popular search engines, [[AltaVista]], relaunched itself as a user Web entry point, or portal.   This unexpected change alienated part of Altavista's user base. Google quickly outgrew its University Avenue home.  After outgrowing two subsequent sites, the company settled into a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
