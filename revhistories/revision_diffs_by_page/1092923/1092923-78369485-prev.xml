  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2004, Google and Keyhole provided [[Google Earth]], a downloadable program that allows the user to zoom into nearly any spot on the earth, close enough to make out cars, and in some cases, people. The technology comes with hundreds of add-ons, like &quot;Crime rate&quot;, to see the crime rate of the city you are zoomed in on, or &quot;3D buildings&quot;, to create 3D models of the towers and buildings of larger cities. There are three available versions, &quot;free edition&quot;, &quot;plus&quot;, and &quot;pro&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 2004, Google launched its own free web-based email service, known as [[Gmail]]. Gmail features improved spam filtering technology, combined with the capability to use Google search technology on individual email messages. Gmail shook up the free, web-based email market by initially offering 1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of email storage, prompting competitors [[Yahoo!]] and [[Hotmail]] to increase their storage quotas considerably. Google has since expanded Gmail's mail quota (and continues to expand it); as of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;August, &lt;/span&gt;2006, the quota was over &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;2.75 &lt;/span&gt;GB. The service generates revenue by displaying advertisements from the [[AdWords]] service that are tailored to the content of the email messages displayed on screen. This feature has proven controversial, with some privacy advocates expressing concern that the company was reading individual emails. Google maintains, however, that the process is fully automated and that no humans read the content of users' messages.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
