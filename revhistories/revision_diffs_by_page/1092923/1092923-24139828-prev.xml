  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In October [[2003]], while discussing a possible [[IPO]] (Initial Public Offering of shares), [[Microsoft]] approached the company  about a possible partnership or [[merger]]; no such deal ever materialized. In January [[2004]], Google announced the hiring of [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group]] to arrange an IPO. That IPO (one of the most anticipated in history) was projected to raise as much as $4 billion. According to a banker involved in the transaction, the deal would yield an estimated $12 billion [[market capitalization]] for Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 29]], [[2004]], Google filed an [[S-1 form]] with the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Securities &lt;/span&gt;and Exchange Commission]] for an [[IPO]] to raise as much as [[United States dollar|USD]] $2,718,281,828 (with a touch of [[e (mathematical constant)#Humorous_use_of_e|mathematical humor]] as e = 2.718281828...). April 29th was the 120th day of 2004, and according to section 12(g) of the [[Securities and Exchange Act]], &quot;a company must file financial and other information with the SEC 120 days after the close of the year in which the company reaches $10 million in assets and/or 500 shareholders, including people with stock options.&quot; [http://management.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/21/1934249&amp;amp;tid=103&amp;amp;tid=4]  Google has stated in its Annual filing for 2004 that every one of its 3,021 employees, &quot;except temporary employees and contractors, are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership&quot;, so Google would have needed to make its financials public by filing them with the SEC regardless of whether or not they intended to make a public offering.  As Google stated in the filing, their &quot;growth has reduced some of the advantages of private ownership. By law, certain private companies must report as if they were public companies. The deadline imposed by this requirement accelerated our decision.&quot;  The SEC filing revealed that Google turned a profit every year since [[2001]] and earned a profit of $105.6 million on revenues of $961.8 million during [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In May [[2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They chose the unconventional way of allocating the initial offering through an auction (specifically, a &quot;[[auction|Dutch auction]]&quot;), so that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers that are allowed to participate in an IPO, however, are around $100,000. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering, but the process didn't run into any technical difficulties or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
