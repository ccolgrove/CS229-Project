  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is known for its relaxed corporate culture, reminiscent of the [[Dot-com]] boom. Google's corporate philosophy is based on many casual principles including: &quot;You can make money without doing evil&quot;, &quot;You can be serious without a suit&quot; and  &quot;Work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.&quot; A complete list of corporate fundamentals is available on Google's Web site [http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html]. The company encourages equality within corporate levels. Twice a week there is a [[roller hockey]] game in the company parking lot. Google's relaxed corporate culture can also be seen externally through their holiday variations of the [[Google logo]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Every Google engineer is encouraged to spend 20 percent (20%) of their work time on projects that interest them. The time can be allocated to one day a week, or pooled into a month. The outcome of this initiative is now seen as Google services, notably [[Adsense]]/[[Adwords]] (which provide the majority of the company's revenue), as well as [[List of Google services and tools#Gmail|Gmail]], [[List of Google services and tools#Google_News|Google News]] and [[List of Google services and tools#Orkut|Orkut]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
