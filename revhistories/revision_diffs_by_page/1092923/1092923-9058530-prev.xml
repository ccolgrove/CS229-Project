  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[May 2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;No one really understood their strong will to use a &quot;[[dutch aution]]&quot; for the initial offering, instead of the regular &quot;[[english acution]]&quot;. The result was that the offering was priced at $85, when the public valued it at $100 on the first day of trading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share.  Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google.  The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control.  The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo!]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was was listed on the [[Nasdaq]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
