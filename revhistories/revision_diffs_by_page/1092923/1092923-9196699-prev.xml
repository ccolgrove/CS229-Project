  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[May 2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They choose the unconvetional way of allocation the initial offering through an acution (and specifically a &quot;[[dutch auction]]&quot;). So that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smalles required account balances at most authorized online brokers were hoewever in $100,000 league. But anyone, at least anyone who was a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;millionaire &lt;/span&gt;(which 2.5 million americans are) could participate. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering. But the process didn't run into any technical difficulties, or result in any significant legal challenges. The result was that a somewhat smaller amount of shares than initially planned were sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control.  The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo!]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was was listed on the [[Nasdaq]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
