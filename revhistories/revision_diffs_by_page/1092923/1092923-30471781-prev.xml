  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many commentators in the world of copyright law and technology were not surprised by this development as The Authors Guild has also been involved in attempting to make online publishers pay royalties to writers whose stories appear in any number of online databases without their express consent. In a concession to general concerns about the nature of their project, Google had announced plans back in August that they would respect the wishes of copyright holders who contacted the company to inform them that they did not want their works included in this digitization project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has also been criticized for allowing gangs of cyberstalkers and defamation leagues based in unmoderated Usenet news groups to use [http://www.fireflysun.com/book/Google_PUBLIC.php Google as a defamation delivery device]. By indexing Usenet news group messages (AKA Google Groups) directly to its Web Search, and by categorically denying requests by complainants to edit libelous or threatening messages out of the Web and Groups archive, Google inspires and emboldens individuals and groups who want to vandalize a victim's corner of the search by front-loading the results of a search on his or her name with links to false and flattering messages and Web-based dossiers. Complainant and social psychologist Wyatt Ehrenfels disclosed evidence that Google staffers threatened to refer him to an enemies of free speech blacklist (chillingeffects.org) if he furnished a legal document that would compel Google to remove a message about him. Just what was Google defending? An off-topic flame that included unpublished residential information about him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
