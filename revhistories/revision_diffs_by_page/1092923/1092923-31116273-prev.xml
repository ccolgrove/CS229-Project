  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in the form of a $100,000 check from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], made out to a corporation which didn't yet exist. After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial investment of almost $1 million. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the major investors being rival venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In October [[2003]], while discussing a possible [[IPO]] (Initial Public Offering of shares), [[Microsoft]] approached the company  about a possible partnership or [[merger]]; no such deal ever materialized. In January [[2004]], Google announced the hiring of [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group]] to arrange an IPO. That IPO (one of the most anticipated in history) was projected to raise as much as $4 billion. According to a banker involved in the transaction, the deal would yield an estimated $12 billion [[market capitalization]] for Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 29]], [[2004]], Google made an [[SEC_Form_S-1|S-1 form]] [[SEC filings|SEC filing]] for an [[IPO]] to raise as much as [[United States dollar|USD]] $2,718,281,828 (with a touch of [[e (mathematical constant)#Non-mathematical_uses_of_e|mathematical humor]] as e = 2.718281828...). April 29th was the 120th day of 2004, and according to section 12(g) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], &quot;a company must file financial and other information with the SEC 120 days after the close of the year in which the company reaches $10 million in assets and/or 500 shareholders, including people with stock options.[http://management.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/21/1934249&amp;amp;tid=103&amp;amp;tid=4]  Google has stated in its Annual filing for 2004 that every one of its 3,021 employees, &quot;except temporary employees and contractors, are also equity holders, with significant collective employee ownership&quot;, so Google would have needed to make its financial information public by filing them with the SEC regardless of whether or not they intended to make a public offering.  As Google stated in the filing, their &quot;growth has reduced some of the advantages of private ownership. By law, certain private companies must report as if they were public companies. The deadline imposed by this requirement accelerated our decision.&quot;  The SEC filing revealed that Google turned a profit every year since [[2001]] and earned a profit of $105.6 million on revenues of $961.8 million during [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In May [[2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They chose the unconventional way of allocating the initial offering through an auction (specifically, a &quot;[[auction|Dutch auction]]&quot;), so that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers that are allowed to participate in an IPO, however, are around $100,000. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering, but the process did not run into any technical difficulties or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before Google initiated its initial public offering, Larry Page &amp;amp; Sergey Brin faced legal action for giving [[Playboy]] an interview about themselves and Google. The SEC (Security &amp;amp; Exchange Commission) forbids giving out information pertaining to a company's specifications before an IPO is launched.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as [[Square root of two|&amp;amp;#8730;2]] = 1.4142135...) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control. The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. [[Yahoo!]], a competitor of Google, also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[August 18]] [[2005]] (one year after the initial IPO), Google announced that it would sell 14,159,265 (a mathematical joke, see [[pi]]) more shares of its stock to raise money. The move would double Google's cash stockpile to $7 billion. Google said it would use the money for &quot;acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets&quot;. [http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=169400356]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;===Today===&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization has risen greatly and the stock price has more than quadrupled. On [[August 19]], [[2004]] the number of [[shares outstanding]] was 172.85 million while the &quot;[[free float]]&quot; was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by [[insider]]s). In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by insiders which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The actual voting power of the insiders is much higher, however, as Google has a dual class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one.  Page says in the [[prospectus]] that Google has &quot;a dual class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.&quot;  The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
