After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company settled into their current home in a complex of buildings in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, in 2003.  The complex has since become known as the [[Googleplex]]. [[Silicon Graphics]] leased the buildings to Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions. This appearance, while imitating the early [[AltaVista]], had behind it Google's unique search capabilities. In &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;2000 &lt;/span&gt;Google began selling [[advertising|advertisement]]s associated with search [[keyword (internet search)|keyword]]s. This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of hits users make upon ads. The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and clickthroughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com]] (later renamed Overture, then Yahoo! Search Marketing).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html Yahoo! Search Marketing Website].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
