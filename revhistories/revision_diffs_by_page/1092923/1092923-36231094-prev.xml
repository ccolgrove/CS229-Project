  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in January [[1996]] &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; by [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  They hypothesized that a search engine that analyzed the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than existing techniques. (Contemporary search engines essentially ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page.) It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called [[RankDex]] was already exploring a similar strategy.)  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] website with the domain ''google.stanford.edu'' (see the [http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Internet Archive Wayback Machine] search for [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://google.stanford.edu http://google.stanford.edu]). The domain ''google.com'' was registered on [[September 15]], &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[1997]],original the site was meant to be googol (as in googol the number which is 1 followed by 100 zeros,this was chosen to to represent all the webpages they wanted to have on there system)but when registering the name it was mis-spelled by accident and not picked up on till the next day,upon which they found out googol was taken. &lt;/span&gt;They formally incorporated their company, ''Google Inc.'', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;California))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

This unexpected change alienated part of AltaVista's user base. Google quickly outgrew its University Avenue home.  After outgrowing two subsequent sites, the company settled into a complex of buildings in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
