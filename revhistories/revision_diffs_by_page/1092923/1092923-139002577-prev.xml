  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has also developed several desktop applications, including [[Google Earth]], an interactive mapping program powered by satellite imagery that covers the vast majority of the earth.  Google Earth is generally considered to be remarkably accurate and extremely detailed.  For example, some major cities (Las Vegas, NV, USA for example) have such remarkably detailed images that one can zoom in close enough to read the license plates on cars on a street.  Consequently, there have been some concerns about national security implications.  Specifically, some countries and militaries contend the software can be used to pinpoint with near-precision accuracy the physical location of critical infrastructure, commercial and residential buildings, bases, government agencies, and so on.  However, the satellite images are not necessarily frequently updated, and all of them are available at no charge through other products and even government sources ([[NASA]] and the [[NGA|National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], for example.)  Some counter this argument by stating that Google Earth makes it easier to access and research the images.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
