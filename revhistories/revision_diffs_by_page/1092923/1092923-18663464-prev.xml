  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in early [[1996]] by [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]]   and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] who developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant ones, Page and Brin decided to test their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. The domain www.google.com was registered on [[September 15]] [[1997]]. They formally founded their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]] [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google got a big break in [[1999]] when [[Altavista]], one of the most popular search engines, relaunched as a Web portal, which alienated part of its user base. Google quickly &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;outgrow &lt;/span&gt;the University Avenue site.  After further outgrowing two other sites, the company settled on a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine gained a following among [[Internet]] users for its simple, clean design (imitating the early Altavista) and relevant search results. In [[2000]], Google had begun selling [[advertisement]]s by the [[keyword]] so that they would be more relevant to the end user. The ads were text-based in order to keep page design uncluttered and fast-loading. It also only cost a very small amount per click to the websites that advertised this way. The concept of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Overture Services Inc.]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml], formerly Goto.com. While many of its [[dot-com]] siblings went under, Google quietly rose in stature while turning a profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
