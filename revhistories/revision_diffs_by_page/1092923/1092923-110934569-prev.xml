  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;share. &lt;/span&gt;Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as [[Square root of two|â2]] â 1.4142135) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders. The sale raised [[United States dollar|$]]1.67 Billion, of which approximately $1.2 Billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control. The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 Billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. [[Yahoo!]], a competitor of Google, also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
