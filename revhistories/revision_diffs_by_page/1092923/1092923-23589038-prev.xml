  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;FUCK GOOGLE MAN COPPORATE SELLOUTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;research project in January [[1996]] &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; by [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]]   and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  They developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce improved results over the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;â&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. The domain 'www.google.com' was registered on [[September 15]] [[1997]]. They formally incorporated their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]] [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home to a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google received a big break in [[1999]] when one of the most popular search engines, [[Altavista]], relaunched itself as a user Web entry point, or portal.   This unexpected change alienated part of Altavista's user base. Google quickly outgrew its University Avenue home.  After outgrowing two subsequent sites, the company settled into a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions.  This appearance, while imitating the early Altavista, had behind it Google's unique search capabilities. In [[2000]], Google began selling [[advertisement]]s associated with the search [[keyword]] to produce enhanced search results for the user.  This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of &quot;hits&quot; users make upon ads.  The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. It also only cost a very small amount per click to the websites that advertised this way. The model of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com (renamed Overture, and now Yahoo! Search Marketing)]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml]. While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;{{US patent|6,285,999}} describing Google's ranking mechanism ([[PageRank]]) was granted on [[September 4]] [[2001]]. The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In February [[2003]], Google acquired [[Pyra Labs]], owner of [[Blogger]], a pioneering and leading [[weblog]] hosting Web site. Some analysts considered the acquisition inconsistent with  Google's business model. However, the acquisition secured the company's competitive ability to use information gleaned from [[blog]] postings to improve the speed and relevance of articles contained in a companion product to the search engine, [[Google News]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;At its peak in early [[2004]], Google handled upwards of 80 percent of all search requests on the world wide web through its Web site and through its partnerships with other internet clients like [[Yahoo!]], [[AOL]], and [[CNN]].[http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox21.html]  In February [[2004]] Yahoo! dropped its partnership with Google in order to provide users at its site independent search results and to maintain their loyalty.  Google lost user share of the search market.  Yet Yahoo!'s move highlighted Google's own distinctiveness and today the verb &quot;to Google&quot; has entered a number of languages first as a [[slang]] verb and now as a standard word meaning, &quot;to perform a web search using Google's search engine&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's declared [[code of conduct]] is &quot;[[Don't Be Evil]]&quot;, a phrase which they went so far as to include in their [[prospectus]] (AKA &quot;red herring&quot; or &quot;S-1&quot;) for their [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]], noting &quot;We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served &amp;amp;#8212; as shareholders and in all other ways &amp;amp;#8212; by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google site includes humorous features such as cartoon modifications [http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html] of the Google logo to recognize special occasions and anniversaries.  Not only may decorative drawings be attached to the logo, but as well the font design may mimic a fictional or humorous language such as the Star Trek [[Klingon language|Klingon]][http://www.google.com/intl/xx-klingon/] and [[Leet]][http://www.google.com/intl/xx-hacker/].  The logo is notorious among web users for [[April Fool's]] Day tie-ins and jokes [http://www.google.com/googlegulp/] about the company.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Analysts speculate that Google's response to Yahoo! will be to continue to make technical and visual enhancements to personalized searches, using the personal data that is gathering from [[Orkut]], [[Gmail]], and [[Froogle]] to produce unique results based on the user. And almost every day a new Google enhancement or product appears in its inventory.  In fact, there is a [http://labs.google.com/personalized Personalized Google Search] Beta in [http://labs.google.com/ Google Labs], the experimental section of Google.com. Google maximizes its relationships with its users by including users in the beta development, design and testing of new enhancements and products.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name 'Google' is a play on the word '[[Googol]]', which was coined by [[Milton Sirotta]], nine-year-old nephew of [[United States|U.S.]] [[mathematician]] [[Edward Kasner]] in [[1938]], to refer to the number represented by 1 followed by one hundred zeros.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's use of the term reflects the company's mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the Web. As a further play on this, Google's headquarters are referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot; - a [[googolplex]] being 1 followed by a googol of zeros, and the HQ being a [[complex]] of buildings (and ''cf'' [[multiplex]], cineplex, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The name has also been interpreted as a merging of the words 'Go ogle', though this is widely accepted to be coincidental. To &quot;throw a googly&quot; means to ask  a difficult or unanswerable question in British slang, a googly being a tricky ball in the game of cricket. ''Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1972) allows the verb &quot;to google&quot; from this. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in the form of a $100,000 check from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], made out to a corporation which didn't yet exist. After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial investment of almost $1 million. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the major investors being rival venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In October [[2003]], while discussing a possible [[IPO]] (Initial Public Offering of shares), [[Microsoft]] approached the company  about a possible partnership or [[merger]]; no such deal ever materialized. In January [[2004]], Google announced the hiring of [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs Group]] to arrange an IPO. That IPO (one of the most anticipated in history) was projected to raise as much as $4 billion. According to a banker involved in the transaction, the deal would yield an estimated $12 billion [[market capitalization]] for Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 29]], [[2004]], Google filed an [[S-1 form]] with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] for an [[IPO]] to raise as much as [[United States dollar|USD]] $2,718,281,828 (with a touch of [[e (mathematical constant)#Humorous_use_of_e|mathematical humor]] as e = 2.718281828...). April 29th was the 120th day of 2004, and according to section 12(g) of the [[Securities and Exchange Act]], &quot;a company must file financial and other information with the SEC 120 days after the close of the year in which the company reaches $10 million in assets and/or 500 shareholders, including people with stock options.&quot; [http://management.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/21/1934249&amp;amp;tid=103&amp;amp;tid=4]  Google has stated in its Annual filing for 2004 that every one of its 3,021 employees, &quot;except temporary employees and contractors, are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership&quot;, so Google would have needed to make its financials public by filing them with the SEC regardless of whether or not they intended to make a public offering.  As Google stated in the filing, their &quot;growth has reduced some of the advantages of private ownership. By law, certain private companies must report as if they were public companies. The deadline imposed by this requirement accelerated our decision.&quot;  The SEC filing revealed that Google turned a profit every year since [[2001]] and earned a profit of $105.6 million on revenues of $961.8 million during [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In May [[2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They chose the unconventional way of allocating the initial offering through an auction (specifically, a &quot;[[auction|Dutch auction]]&quot;), so that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers that are allowed to participate in an IPO, however, are around $100,000. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering, but the process didn't run into any technical difficulties or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as [[Square root of two|&amp;amp;#8730;2]] = 1.4142135...) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control. The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. [[Yahoo!]], a competitor of Google, also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-marker&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[August 18]] [[2005]] (one year after the initial IPO), Google announced that it would sell 14,159,265 (a mathematical joke, see [[pi]]) more shares of its stock to raise money. The move would double Google's cash stockpile to $7 billion. Google said it would use the money for &quot;acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets&quot;.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before Google initiated its initial public offering, Larry Page &amp;amp; Sergey Brin faced legal action for giving Playboy an interview about themselves and Google. The SEC (Security &amp;amp; Exchange Commission) forbids giving out information pertaining to a company's specifications before an IPO is launched.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization has risen greatly and the stock price has tripled. On [[August 19]], [[2004]] the number of [[shares outstanding]] was 172.85 million while the &quot;[[free float]]&quot; was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by [[insider]]s). In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by insiders which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The actual voting power of the insiders is much higher, however, as Google has a dual class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one.  Page says in the [[prospectus]] that Google has &quot;a dual class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.&quot;  The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[June 1]], [[2005]], Google shares gained nearly 4 percent after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its price target on the stock to $350.  On the same day, rumors circulated in the financial community that Google would soon be included in the [[S&amp;amp;P 500]]. (Source: {{Web reference | title=Google Shares Rise on New Price Target | work=L.A.Times | URL=http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/wire/sns-ap-google-price-target,1,2312669.story?coll=sns-ap-investing-headlines&amp;amp;ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true | date=June 1 | year=2005}}) When companies are first listed on the S&amp;amp;P 500 they typically experience a bump in share price. On [[June 7]], 2005, Google was valued at nearly $52 billion, making it one of the world's biggest media company by stock market value.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. One such example is the rivalry between Microsoft and Google [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. The two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail ([[Gmail]] vs. [[Hotmail]]), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's [[Virtual Earth]] competes with [[Google Earth]]). Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing its own [[operating system]] to directly compete with [[Microsoft Windows]]. Rumors of a google browser are fueled by the fact that Google is the owner of the [[domain name]] &quot;gbrowser.com&quot;. This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. Microsoft has been touting its new [[MSN Search]] engine to counter Google's competitive position. This feud boiled over into the courts when Kai-Fu Lee, a former vice-president of Microsoft, quit Microsoft to work for Google. Microsoft sued to stop his move by citing Lee's non-compete contract (he had acess to much sensitive information regarding Microsoft's plans in China). [http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=internetNews&amp;amp;storyID=2005-09-02T215817Z_01_MCC278865_RTRIDST_0_NET-MICROSOFT-GOOGLE-DC.XML] The case is still in the courts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While Google is the #1 search engine overall, the company struggles to keep up with rivals such as the well known Yahoo. Although Google and Yahoo differ greatly in the services they offer, Google is trying to redefine itself from an internet search company to an internet media company, similar to Yahoo. Google is trying to become a jack of all trades for the internet. They are foraying into other businesses which other companies have recently dominated. On June 21st 2005 Google announced it has plans to release a pay service and a classified ads service, to rival companies like Ebay [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/20/business/google.php].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
