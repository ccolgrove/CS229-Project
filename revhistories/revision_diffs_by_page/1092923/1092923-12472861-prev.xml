  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is a [[multinational corporation]], having offices in over a dozen countries [http://www.google.com/jobs/positions.html].  In order to comply with the varying laws of these countries, several versions of Google restrict very specific keyword searches. According to [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] law, for example, [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]] are illegal. Google complies with these laws by banning keyword searches related to these terms.  [[China]], whose [[Human_rights_in_China|human rights record]] has been widely criticized by the international community, has in the past restricted citizen access to popular search engines such as [[Altavista]], [[Yahoo!]], and Google.  This complete ban is currently lifted, however the government remains proactive in filtering internet content.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's efforts to refine its database has led to some legal controversy, notably a lawsuit in October 2002 from the company SearchKing which sought to sell advertisements on pages with inflated Google rankings. In its defense, Google stated that its rankings are its constitutionally protected opinions of the web sites that it indexes.  A judge subsequently threw out SearchKing's lawsuit in mid-2003 on precisely these grounds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
