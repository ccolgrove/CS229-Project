  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's hiring policy is aggressively non-discriminatory and favors ability over experience.

For example, some [[system administrator]]s earned no more than $33,000&amp;amp;ndash;$40,000 per year; at that time it was considered to be low for the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] job market. Nevertheless, Google's excellent stock performance following the IPO has enabled these early employees to be competitively compensated by participation in the corporation's remarkable equity growth. In &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;2005, &lt;/span&gt;Google has implemented other employee incentives such as the [[Google Founders' Award]], in addition to offering higher salaries to new employees. Google's workplace amenities, culture, global popularity, and strong brand recognition have also attracted potential applicants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
