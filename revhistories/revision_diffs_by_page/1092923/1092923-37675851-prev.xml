  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's headquarters is called the [[Googleplex]]. The lobby is decorated with a piano, [[lava lamps]], and a real-time projection of current search queries. The hallways are full of exercise balls and [[bicycle]]s. Each employee has access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus, and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted [[video game]]s, [[Foosball]], a [[piano|baby grand piano]], a pool table, and [[ping pong]]. In addition to the [[Recreation room|rec room]], there are snack rooms stocked with various [[cereal]]s, [[gummy bear]]s, [[toffee]], [[licorice]], [[cashew]]s, [[yogurt]], [[carrot]]s, fresh fruit, and dozens of different drinks including fresh [[juice]], [[soft drink|soda]], and make-your-own [[cappuccino]]. The building also offers state-of-the-art bathroom facilities featuring digitally controlled toilets [http://flickr.com/photos/tedsblog/331770/in/set-85413] which are similar to [[Japanese toilet]]s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

One can find other pranks hidden between Google's pages. In the languages list one can find the [http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/ Bork! Bork! Bork!] version. Bork! is the mock Swedish of the Muppet Show's [[Swedish Chef]]. They also offer versions in [[Pig Latin]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. Some people thought the announcement of [[Gmail]] in 2004 around April Fools Day (as well as the doubling of Gmail's storage space to two gigabytes in 2005) was a joke. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;hunter causey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
