  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions.  This appearance, while imitating the early Altavista, had behind it Google's unique search capabilities. In [[2000]], Google began selling [[advertisement]]s associated with the search [[keyword]] to produce enhanced search results for the user.  This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of &quot;hits&quot; users make upon ads.  The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. It also only cost a very small amount per click to the websites that advertised this way. The model of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com (renamed Overture, and now Yahoo! Search Marketing)]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml]. While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
