  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[September 20]], 2005, the Authors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, with a children's book author, and a former Poet Laureate of the United States,  filed a class action suit in federal court in Manhattan against Google over its unauthorized scanning and copying of books through its &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Google Library &lt;/span&gt;program. The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction that will prevent the company from continuing their very ambitious digitization project.  Arguments in the case will hinge around the interpretation of [[Fair use#Fair use under United States law|the four factors of Fair Use]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
