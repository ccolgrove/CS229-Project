They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions.  This appearance, while imitating the early AltaVista, had behind it &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Google's &lt;/span&gt;unique search capabilities. In 2000, &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Google &lt;/span&gt;began selling [[advertisement]]s associated with the search [[keyword]] to produce enhanced search results for the user.  This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of &quot;hits&quot; users make upon ads.  The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. It also only cost a very small amount per click to the websites that advertised this way.
