  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization has risen greatly and the stock price has more than quadrupled. On [[August 19]], [[2004]] the number of [[shares outstanding]] was 172.85 million while the &quot;[[Float (finance)|free float]]&quot; was 19.60 million (which makes 89% held by [[insider]]s). In January 2005 the shares outstanding was up 100 million to 273.42 million, 53% of that was held by insiders which made the float 127.70 million (up 110 million shares from the first trading day). The two founders are said to hold almost 30% of the outstanding shares. The actual voting power of the insiders is much higher, however, as Google has a dual class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one.  Page says in the [[prospectus]] that Google has &quot;a dual class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.&quot;  The company has not reported any [[treasury stock]] holdings as of the Q3 2004 &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
