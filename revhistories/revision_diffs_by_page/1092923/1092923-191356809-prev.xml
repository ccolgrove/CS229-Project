Google is also in the process of constructing a major operations center in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], on the banks of the [[Columbia River]]. The site, also referred to by the media as ''Project 02'', was chosen due to the availability of inexpensive [[hydroelectric power]] and a large surplus of [[fiber optic]] cable, left over from the dot com boom of the late 1990s. The computing center is estimated to be as large as two [[American football|football fields]], and it has created hundreds of construction jobs, causing local real estate prices to increase 40%.
