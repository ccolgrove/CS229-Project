  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users &lt;/span&gt;who &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;did not wish to enter searches &lt;/span&gt;on &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;web pages filled with visual distractions. This appearance imitated [[AltaVista]]'s, but incorporated Google's unique search capabilities. &lt;/span&gt;In &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;2000, &lt;/span&gt;Google began selling [[advertising|advertisements]] associated with search [[keyword (internet search)|keywords]]. This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of hits users make upon ads. The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and clickthroughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com]] (later renamed Overture Services, before being acquired by [[Yahoo!]] and rebranded as [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]]). While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
