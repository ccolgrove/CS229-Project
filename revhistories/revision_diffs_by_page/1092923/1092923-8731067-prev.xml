  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in early [[1996]] by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students who developed the theory that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;websites &lt;/span&gt;would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine gained a following among [[Internet]] users for its simple, clean design and relevant search results. [[Advertisement]]s were sold by the [[keyword]] so that they would be more relevant to the end user, and the ads were text-based in order to keep page design uncluttered and fast-loading.

While many of its [[dot-com]] siblings went under, Google quietly rose in stature while turning a profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A number of organizations (most controversially the [[Church of Scientology]]) have used the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to demand that Google remove references to allegedly [[copyright]]ed material on other sites. Google typically handles this by removing the link as requested and including a link to the complaint in the search results. There have also been complaints that the &quot;Google cache&quot; feature violates copyright. However, the consensus seems to be that caching is a normal part of the functionality of the web, and that [[HTTP]] provides adequate mechanisms for requesting that caching be disabled (which Google respects; it also honors the [[robots.txt]] file which is a mechanism to allow the owners of a site to request that part or all of their site not be included in search engine listings).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

When Gmail was announced, this was vastly more than that of most other free [[webmail]] providers&amp;amp;mdash;for example, [[Microsoft]]'s [[Hotmail]] only offered 2 MB, and [[Yahoo!]]'s Mail service offered 4 MB. In response to Gmail, these limits have been upgraded, to 250 MB. Other &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Web mail &lt;/span&gt;providers have followed suit, some of them now offering larger storage than Gmail. On [[November 13]], [[2004]] Google anounced that Gmail will be [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]] compatible and have e-mail forwarding for no extra charge. This means that people will be able  to read their mail through a POP3 compatible e-mail client like [[Outlook Express]]. Most other online email services charge for a POP3 connectivity and message forwarding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;As of [[August 25]], [[2004]], the service was being tested internally. It is not known when the service will be made available to the public. However, the service is available to [[Blogger]] users and by invitation from current [[Gmail]] users. However, the invites system has led to Gmail invites being exchanged for cash and goods through &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;websites &lt;/span&gt;like [http://www.gmailswap.com/ Gmail swap], making Google change its policy on invites by disallowing cash exchanges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There has been a great deal of criticism regarding Gmail's privacy policy.[http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/privacy.html] Much of the controversy involved the clause &quot;residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of your account.&quot; Many believed that this meant that Google would intentionally archive copies of deleted mail forever. Google later stated that they will &quot;make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practical.&quot; Most of the criticism, however, was against Google's plans to add context-sensitive advertisements to e-mails by automatically scanning them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
