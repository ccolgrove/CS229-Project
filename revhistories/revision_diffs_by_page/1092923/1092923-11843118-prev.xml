  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[March 2005]], [[Agence France Presse]] (AFP) sued Google for $17.5 million, alleging that [[Google News]] infringed on its copyright because &quot;Google includes AFPâs photos, stories and news headlines on Google News without permission from Agence France Presse.&quot; [http://news.dcealumni.com/376/20305-googles-news-sued-for-infringing-agence-france-presse-copyrighted-work/]   It was also alleged that Google ignored a [[cease and desist]] order, though Google counters that it has opt-out procedures which AFP could have followed but did not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is possible that AFP will make additional arguments in court that it has not yet made in public, but currently, many pundits are confused by the decision to sue [http://weblog.physorg.com/news1362.html][http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=3538][http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/2080.html] because Google does not display the full article on its site, provides a link to one of AFP's 600 online clients such as [[Channel News Asia]] (which presumably benefits AFP because more people view the article and advertising), and because the articles are available via the providers' websites regardless of Google's actions.  It was argued that had AFP wanted to prevent free use of its articles, it should have asked its providers to require subscriptions rather than suing google.  Additionally, &quot;in 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that Web sites may reproduce and post 'thumbnail' or down-sized versions of copyrighted photographs,&quot; so Google News' [[thumbnail]]s are likely legal. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[http://news.dcealumni.com/376/20305-googles-news-sued-for-infringing-agence-france-presse-copyrighted-work/]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to the [[Canada Free Press]], &quot;Google Inc. is now attempting to remove all postings of Agence-France Presse material from its site, although AFP spokesmen say that even if this is done, the lawsuit will continue...  It seems that the basis of the lawsuit is just the abstract notion of copyright without any real damages to justify the action.&quot;  The article concluded &quot; It would be a sad day for those who look to the Internet for news if AFP is successful in limiting what Google can display... FPâs lawsuit, if successful, is bound to have a major impact on how news is delivered on the Internet.&quot;[http://www.torontofreepress.com/2005/media032905.htm]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The lawsuit's outcome will likely depend on whether Google can win that its use of AFP's material constitutes &quot;fair use&quot; under copyright law.  Google could even argue that it &quot;adds value&quot; to AFP's news without harming the French news wholesaler.[http://www.michigandaily.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/03/29/424942b9271ad]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
