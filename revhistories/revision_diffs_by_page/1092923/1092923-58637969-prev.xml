  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originally, typical salaries at Google were considered to be quite low by industry standards. For example, some [[system administrator]]s earned no more than [[United States Dollar|$]]33,000 &amp;amp;mdash; while $40,000 at that time was considered to be low for the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] job market. Nevertheless, Google's excellent stock performance following the IPO has enabled these early employees to be competitively compensated by participation in the corporation's remarkable equity growth. In 2005, Google has implemented other employee incentives such as the [[Google Founders' Award]], in addition to offering higher salaries to new employees. Google's workplace amenities, culture, global popularity, and strong brand recognition have also attracted potential applicants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
