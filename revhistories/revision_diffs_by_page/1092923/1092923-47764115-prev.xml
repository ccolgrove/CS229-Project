In [[2002]], they claimed that [[pigeons]] were the [[Google's hoaxes#2002: Pigeon Rank|secret]] behind their growing [[search engine]]. In [[2004]], it featured [[Google's hoaxes#2004: Google Lunar/Copernicus Center|Google Lunar]], which featured jobs on the [[moon]] and in [[2005]], a [[fiction|fictitious]] brain-boosting drink termed, [[Google's hoaxes#2005: Google Gulp|Google Gulp]] was announced. One can find other pranks hidden between Google's pages. Additionally, in the languages list one can find the [http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/ Bork! Bork! Bork!] version, imitating the [[Muppet Show]]'s [[Swedish Chef]]. They also offer versions in [[Pig Latin]], [[Elmer Fudd]], and [[Klingon]]. Some people thought the announcement of [[Gmail]] in [[2004]] around April Fool's Day (as well as the doubling of Gmail's storage space to two gigabytes in [[2005]]) was a joke.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
