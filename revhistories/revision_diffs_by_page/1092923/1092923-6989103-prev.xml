  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There has been a great deal of criticism regarding Gmail's privacy policy.[http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/privacy.html] Much of the controversy involved the clause &quot;residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of your account.&quot; Many believed that this meant that Google would intentionally archive copies of deleted mail forever. Google later stated that they will &quot;make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practical.&quot; Most of the criticism, however, was against Google's plans to add context-sensitive advertisements to e-mails by automatically scanning them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
