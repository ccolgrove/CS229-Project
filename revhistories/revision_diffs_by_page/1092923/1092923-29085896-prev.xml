To &quot;throw a googly&quot; means to ask  a difficult or unanswerable question in British slang, a googly being a tricky ball in the game of cricket. ''Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1972) allows the verb &quot;to google&quot; from this, and the phrase has come to be synonymous with &quot;to search for on the Internet&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
