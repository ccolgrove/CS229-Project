  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is a [[multinational corporation]], having offices in over a dozen countries [http://www.google.ie/intl/en/corporate/address.html].  In order to comply with the varying laws of these countries, several versions of Google restrict very specific keyword searches. According to [[US|American]] law, any copyright owner can require material to be removed via the [[DMCA|Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], whereas under [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] law, for example, [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]] are illegal. Google complies with these laws by banning keyword searches related to these terms. The [[People's Republic of China]], whose [[human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]] has been widely criticized by the international community, has in the past restricted citizen access to popular search engines such as [[Altavista]], [[Yahoo!]], and Google. The mirror search site [[Elgoog|elgooG]] has been used by Chinese citizens to get around blocked content. This complete ban is currently lifted. However, the government remains &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;proactive &lt;/span&gt;in filtering Internet content.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
