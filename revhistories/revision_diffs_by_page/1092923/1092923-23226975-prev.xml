  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions.  This appearance, while imitating the early Altavista, had behind it Google's unique search capabilities. In [[2000]], Google began selling &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[advertisement]]s &lt;/span&gt;associated with the search [[keyword]] to produce enhanced search results for the user.  This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of &quot;hits&quot; users make upon ads.  The ads were text-based in order to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;maintain &lt;/span&gt;an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. It also only cost a very small &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;amount &lt;/span&gt;per click to the websites that advertised this way. The model of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;[[Yahoo! &lt;/span&gt;Search Marketing|Goto.com (renamed Overture, and now Yahoo! Search Marketing)]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml]. While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

After a frantic few weeks, this was topped up to give an initial &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;investment &lt;/span&gt;of almost $1 million. Around six months later, a much larger round of funding was announced, with the major investors being rival venture capital firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

That IPO (one of the most anticipated in history) was projected to raise as much as $4 billion.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 29]], [[2004]], Google filed an [[S-1 form]] with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] for an [[IPO]] to raise as much as [[United States dollar|USD]] $2,718,281,828 (with a touch of [[e &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;(mathematical &lt;/span&gt;constant)#Humorous_use_of_e|mathematical humor]] as e = 2.718281828...). April 29th was the 120th day of 2004, and according to section 12(g) of the [[Securities and Exchange Act]], &quot;a company must file financial and other information with the SEC 120 days after the close of the year in which the company reaches $10 million in assets and/or 500 shareholders, including people with stock options.&quot; [http://management.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/21/1934249&amp;amp;tid=103&amp;amp;tid=4]  Google has stated in its Annual filing for 2004 that every one of its 3,021 employees, &quot;except temporary employees and contractors, are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership&quot;, so Google would have needed to make its financials public by filing them with the SEC regardless of whether or not they intended to make a public offering.  As Google stated in the filing, their &quot;growth has reduced some of the advantages of private ownership. By law, certain private companies must report as if they were public companies. The deadline imposed by this requirement accelerated our decision.&quot;  The SEC filing revealed that Google turned a profit every year since [[2001]] and earned a profit of $105.6 million on revenues of $961.8 million during [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In May [[2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They chose the unconventional way of allocating the initial offering through an auction (specifically, a &quot;[[auction|Dutch auction]]&quot;), so that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers that are allowed to participate in an IPO, however, are around $100,000. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering, but the process didn't run into any technical difficulties or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
