  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is known for its relaxed corporate culture, reminiscent of the [[Dot-com]] boom. Google's corporate philosophy is based on many casual principles including: &quot;You can make money without doing evil&quot;, &quot;You can be serious without a suit&quot; and  &quot;Work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.&quot; A complete list of corporate fundamentals is available on Google's Web site [http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html]. The company encourages equality within corporate levels. Twice a week there is a [[roller hockey]] game in the company parking lot. Google's relaxed corporate culture can also be seen externally through their holiday variations of the [[Google logo]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Every Google engineer is encouraged to spend 20 percent (20%) of their work time on projects that interest them. The time can be allocated to one day a week, or pooled into a month. The outcome of this initiative is now seen as Google services, notably [[Adsense]]/[[Adwords]] (which provide the majority of the company's revenue), as well as [[List of Google services and tools#Gmail|Gmail]], [[List of Google services and tools#Google_News|Google News]] and [[List of Google services and tools#Orkut|Orkut]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google's headquarters is called the [[Googleplex]]. The lobby is decorated with a piano, [[lava lamps]], and a real-time projection of current search queries. The hallways are full of exercise balls and [[bicycle]]s. Each employee has access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus, and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted [[video game]]s, [[Foosball]], a [[piano|baby grand piano]], a pool table, and [[ping pong]]. In addition to the [[Recreation room|rec room]], there are snack rooms stocked with various [[cereal]]s, [[gummy bear]]s, [[toffee]], [[licorice]], [[cashew]]s, [[yogurt]], [[carrot]]s, fresh fruit, and dozens of different drinks including fresh [[juice]], [[soft drink|soda]], and make-your-own [[cappuccino]]. The building also offers state-of-the-art bathroom facilities featuring digitally controlled toilets [http://flickr.com/photos/tedsblog/331770/in/set-85413] which are similar to [[Japanese toilet]]s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google has a tradition of creating [[April Fool's Day]] jokes such as [http://www.google.com/mentalplex/ Google MentalPlex] which featured the use of mental power to search the Web. In 2002 they claimed that [[pigeons]] were the [http://www.google.com/technology/pigeonrank.html secret] behind their growing [[search engine]]. In 2004 it featured [http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html Google Lunar] which featured jobs on the [[moon]] and in 2005 a [[fiction|fictitious]], brain-boosting drink termed [http://www.google.com/googlegulp/ Google Gulp] was announced. One can find other pranks hidden between Google's pages. In the languages list one can find the [http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/ Bork! Bork! Bork!] version. Bork! is the mock Swedish of the Muppet Show's [[Swedish Chef]]. They also offer versions in [[Pig Latin]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. Some people thought the announcement of [[Gmail]] in 2004 around April Fools Day (as well as the doubling of Gmail's storage space to two gigabytes in 2005) was a joke.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many people have suggested that after Google's IPO the corporate culture will not be able to stay so &quot;fun&quot; and focused on the future.[http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,63241,00.html?tw=wn_story_related] [http://www.ciol.com/content/news/2004/104043001.asp]  The company may be required to answer to its new shareholders who may press the company to reduce employee benefits and to focus on short term advances. Also, it may be more challenging for the company to maintain a collegial atmosphere when approximately 1,000 (30%) of the employees are paper-millionaires. In a report given to potential investors, co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page promised that the IPO would not change the company's culture. Later Mr. Page said, &quot;We think a lot about how to maintain our culture and the fun elements.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
