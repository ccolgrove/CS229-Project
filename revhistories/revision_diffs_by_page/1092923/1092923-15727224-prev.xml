  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in early [[1996]] by [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;candidates &lt;/span&gt;at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] who developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small searchengine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant ones, Page and Brin decided to test their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. The domain www.google.com was registered on [[September 15]] [[1997]]. They formally founded their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]] [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google got a big break in [[1999]] when [[Altavista]], the most popular search engine among knowledgeable users, relaunched as a portal and alienated those users.  Google quickly outgrew the University Avenue site.  After further outgrowing two other sites, the company settled on a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Google's increased size comes more competition from large mainstream technology companies. The rivalry between Microsoft and Google has been cited most often [http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1706872,00.asp]. The two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as desktop and online search, webmail and browsers. Some have even suggested that in addition to an [[Internet Explorer]] replacement Google is designing a [[List_of_Google_services_and_tools#Google_Operating_System|Google operating system]] to directly compete with [[Microsoft Windows]]. This corporate feud is most directly expressed in hiring offers and defections. Many Microsoft employees who worked on Internet Explorer have left to work for Google. In retribution, Microsoft has been touting its new [[MSN Search]] engine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
