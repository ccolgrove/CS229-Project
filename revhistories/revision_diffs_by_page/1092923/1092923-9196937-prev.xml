  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[April 29]], [[2004]], Google filed an [[S-1 form]] with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] for an [[IPO]] to raise as much as [[United States dollar|USD]] $2,718,281,828 (with a touch of [[e (mathematical constant)#Humorous_use_of_e|mathematical humor]] in the exact amount). The filing revealed that Google turned a profit every year since [[2001]] and earned a profit of $105.6 million on revenues of $961.8 million during [[2003]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[May 2004]], Google officially cut [[Goldman Sachs]] from the IPO, leaving [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] as the joint underwriters. They choose the unconvetional way of allocation the initial offering through an auction (and specifically a &quot;[[dutch auction]]&quot;). So that &quot;anyone&quot; would be able to participate in the offering. The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers to be allowed to participate in an IPO were hoewever in the $100,000 league. But if the broker requirements weren't so high anyone could theoretically have been able to buy one share of the first offering. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering. But the process didn't run into any technical difficulties, or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some initial stumbles, Google's initial public offering took place on [[August 19]], [[2004]]. 19,605,052 [[stock|shares]] were offered at a price of $85 per share. Of that, 14,142,135 were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders.  The sale raised $1.67 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion went to Google. The vast majority of Google's 271 million shares remained under Google's control.  The IPO gave Google a [[market capitalization]] of more than $23 billion. Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Ironically [[Yahoo!]] also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7 million shares of Google. The company was was listed on the [[Nasdaq]] stock exchange under the [[ticker]] symbol '''GOOG'''.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
