  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in January [[1996]] &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; by [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]]   and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  They developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce improved results over the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] website with the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;domain, &lt;/span&gt;'google.stanford.edu' (see the [http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Internet Archive Wayback Machine] search for [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://google.stanford.edu http://google.stanford.edu]). The domain 'www.google.com' was registered on [[September 15]] [[1997]].

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of [[Internet]] users. They were attracted to its simple, uncluttered, clean design &amp;amp;mdash; a competitive advantage to attract users who did not wish to enter searches on web pages filled with visual distractions.  This appearance, while imitating the early Altavista, had behind it Google's unique search capabilities. In [[2000]], Google began selling [[advertisement]]s associated with the search [[keyword]] to produce enhanced search results for the user.  This strategy was important for increasing advertising revenue, which is based upon the number of &quot;hits&quot; users make upon ads.  The ads were text-based in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. It also only cost a very small amount per click to the websites that advertised this way. The model of selling keyword advertising was originally pioneered by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Goto.com (renamed Overture, and now Yahoo! Search Marketing)]][http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/news/mile.jhtml]. While many of its [[dot-com]] rivals failed in the new internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
