  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originally, typical salaries at Google were considered to be quite low by industry standards. For example, some [[system administrator]]s earned no more than [[United States Dollar|$]]33,000 &amp;amp;mdash; while [[United States Dollar|$]]40,000 at that time was considered to be low for the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] job market. Nevertheless, Google's excellent stock performance following the IPO has enabled these early employees to be competitively compensated by participation in the corporation's remarkable equity growth. In [[2005]], Google has implemented other employee incentives such as the [[Google Founders' Award]], in addition to offering higher salaries to new employees. Google's workplace amenities, culture, global popularity, and strong brand recognition have also attracted potential applicants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
