The smallest required account balances at most authorized online brokers that are allowed to participate in an IPO, however, are around $100,000. In the run-up to the IPO the company was forced to slash the price and size of the offering, but the process didn't run into any technical difficulties or result in any significant legal challenges. The initial offering of shares was sold for $85 a piece. The public valued it at $100.34 at the close of the first day of trading which saw 22,351,900 shares change hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google raised $4 billion in follow-on stock offering, which led to many speculations regarding what the search engine company planned to do with the newly raised cash. Google already had $7 billion in cash prior to the stock offering making a total cash reserve of $11 billion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In late September, Google began providing free [[Wi-Fi]] access around areas in the city of San Francisco. It then announced itself to be one of the bidders in the city's mayor's invitation to companies, to bid for a plan to offer free Wi-Fi in [[San Francisco]]. Google filed 40 minutes before the deadline. Speculators however donot feel that providing the service around other cities of USA is currently on Google's agenda.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
