  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google began as a research project in January 1996 &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; by [[Lawrence E. Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  They hypothesized that a search engine that analyzed the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than existing techniques. (Contemporary search engines essentially ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page.) It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance. (A small search engine called [[RankDex]] was already exploring a similar strategy.)  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. Originally the search engine used the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] website with the domain ''google.stanford.edu''. The domain ''google.com'' was registered on [[September 15]], [[1997]]. They formally incorporated their company, ''Google Inc.'', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Google received a big break in 1999 when one of the most popular search engines, [[AltaVista]], relaunched itself as a user Web entry point, or portal.   This unexpected change alienated part of AltaVista's user base. Google quickly outgrew its University Avenue home.  After outgrowing two subsequent sites, the company settled into a complex of buildings in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in 2003. [[Silicon Graphics]] leased these buildings to Google.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
