  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Google is a [[multinational corporation]], having offices in over a dozen countries [http://www.google.ie/intl/en/corporate/address.html].  In order to comply with the varying laws of these countries, several versions of Google restrict very specific keyword searches. According to American law, any copyright owner can require material to be removed via the [[DMCA|Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], whereas under [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] law, for example, [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]] are illegal. Google complies with these laws by banning keyword searches related to these terms.  Google's Terms of Service allow it to comply with the laws of any one country, providing information that was originated (or that Google stores) in another country.  Any data stored on Google is therefore subject to being turned over to any country, including China.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
