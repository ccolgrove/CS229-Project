Page|Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidates at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] who developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce better results than the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed ''BackRub'' because the system checked [[backlinks]] to estimate a site's importance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The domain www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally founded their company, ''Google, Inc.'', on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California. In February [[1999]], the company moved into offices at [[165 University Avenue]] in [[Palo Alto]], home of a number of other noted [[Silicon Valley]] technology startups.  Google quickly outgrew the University Avenue site.  After further outgrowing two other sites, the company settled on a complex of buildings (known by some as &quot;The Googleplex&quot;) in [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View]] at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in 2003.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
