  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;It has been argued {{weasel-inline}} that necrophilia may not be unethical as is widely believed. The argument given in favor is that the human body is like an aircraft, inhabited by the pilot (the soul). The pilot is the only component which matters. Once the pilot has deserted the aircraft, nobody can commit an unethical act against the aircraft.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McKearn&quot;&amp;gt;McKearn, S.

A further argument is that when a number of non-consensual invasions of the dead body through body orifices, including the vagina - as in embalming - are considered perfectly ethical, why exclude necrophilia only and on which grounds.&amp;lt;ref name=&quot;McKearn&quot;&amp;gt;McKearn, S.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many people think that the deceased would not have given permission for the abuser to have sex if they had still been alive. So in many peoples view it is a form of rape and should be treated as such. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
