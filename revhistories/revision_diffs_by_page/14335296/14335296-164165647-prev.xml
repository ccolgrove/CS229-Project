  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Cleopatra|Cleopatric]] death cults have often combined elements of both institutional thanatophilia and [[libido|libidinal]] necrophilia, with the latter often dominating. Plutarch relates that [[Octavius]]' admiration for Cleopatra only grew after her death, that he ordered she be buried alongside [[Mark Antony|Antony]] in royal splendor, and that on his return to Rome he incorporated an image of the dying Cleopatra (''cum''-[[asp]]) into his [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. Beginning with the [[Renaissance]] and continuing into later centuries individual artists, as well as artistic movements (e.g. [[Romanticism]], [[Decadent movement|Decandatism]]), have demonstrated a veritable passion for and derived much inspiration from Cleopatra's life and death; among the most well known pictorial iterations of Cleopatra's suicide are [[Guido Cagnacci|Cagnacci's]] sensuous ''Death of Cleopatra'' (1658) and [[Jean AndrÃ© Rixen|Rixen's]] brazenly erotic work of the same name (1874). A work that may have inspired Rixen's painting is [[Theophile Gautier|Gautier's]] story ''Une Nuit de ClÃ©opÃ¢tre'' (1838), which includes a [[fantasy|fantastic]]âand an undisguisedly [[fetish|fetishistic]]âdescription of the Egyptian queen's body ''post-mortem'': &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
