  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Macon Dead]] is explaining to his son [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Milkman]] about how he is disturbed by his wife, and Milkman's mother, [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Ruth Dead's]] relationship with her father, [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Dr. Foster]].  Shortly after Dr. Foster's death, Macon caught Ruth lying in bed, naked, with her father's corpse, while sucking on his fingers.  It is not known whether she actually had sex with the dead Dr. Foster, and Macon is believed not to have caught her in the act.  Yet, Macon seems to believe that intercourse occured between Ruth and the corpse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

When she contracts leprosy, she is deserted by all others.  The scribe then takes care of her, and has an arguably necrophilic relationship with her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
