  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;While not necrophilia, [[Romanticism | romantic]] connections between [[romantic love | love]] and [[death]] are a frequent theme in [[Western]] [[art]]istic expression. The [[William Shakespeare | Shakespeare]] [[tragedy]] ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' ends with the young lovers united in death. [[Edgar Allen Poe]] once described the death of a beautiful young woman to be one of the most [[beauty | beautiful]] images. (By this, he was not saying that it is a good thing for young women to die; to him [[melancholy]] and pain were sources of beauty.) Many [[alternative rock]] artists also focus on the connection between romantic love and death, despair, and the occult; in [[Europe]], the most notable example is [[HIM (band) | Him]], and more generally the artists of the [[love metal]] movement. A comparable [[United States | American]] analogue might be [[Stabbing Westward]], a [[goth rock]] band whose songs dealt with [[despair]], [[drug abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], [[death]], and [[romantic love]], often in conjunction. A second [[Goth rock]] band known as the &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Murderdolls, &lt;/span&gt;lead by &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Wednesday 13, &lt;/span&gt;has  created a life style out of singing about Necrophilia and sexual acts with the dead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;An extension of the emotional connection between love and death is love for a person, which remains after death. Some [[ghost stories]] focus on a deceased person's undying love for a living individual, manifest literally in the form of a palpable [[ghost]] or [[poltergeist]]. While it is considered a romantic image for a person to die &quot;in the arms&quot; of a lover, sexual activity with the dead is usually considered [[taboo]], but has appeared in recent [[film]] and [[music]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
