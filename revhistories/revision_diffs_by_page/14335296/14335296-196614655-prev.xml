  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-addedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In some societies the practice was enacted owing to a belief that the soul of an unmarried woman would not find peace; among the Kachin of Myanmar and the Nambudri of India, versions of a marriage ceremony were held to lay a dead virgin to rest, which would involve intercourse with the corpse.  Similar practices obtained in some pre-modern Central European societies when a woman who was engaged to be married died before the wedding.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Walker, Benjamin.

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Antiquity offers numerous examples of what may readily be described as [[cult]]s of thanatophilia; perhaps the most famous of them being that of [[Alexander the Great]]'s, which was physically centered around his [[breastplate]], kept in a [[mausoleum|mausolean]] reliquary in the [[eponymous]] Egyptian city for over five hundred years. More remarkable still are accounts stating that Alexander's body was placed in a [[sarcophagus]] of solid gold and perfectly preserved in a (sterilizing) bath of [[honey]] through the remaining centuries of antiquity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
