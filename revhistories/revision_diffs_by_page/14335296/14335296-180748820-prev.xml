  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Necrophilia was practiced in some ancient cultures as a spiritual means of communicating with the dead, while others employed it as an attempt to revive the recently departed. The evidence of necrophilia practices can be found in the artifacts of the [[Moche]] civilization of [[South America]], where pottery depicting skeletal figures engaged in coitus with living humans are among the ruins. &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Even in ancient [[Egypt]], there is record of the treatment of the bodies of young women that were set out to rot for a few days before being delivered to [[ambalming|embalmers]]. This practice was born from the need to discourage the men performing the funerary customs from having sexual interest in their charges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
