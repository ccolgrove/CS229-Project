If she's naked I would dress her that way. I would take her and first, lick her clit and kiss all over her then I would place my dildo between those pink pussy lips and fuck her and rub my pussy all over her gorgeous dead face untill I came to the a nice wet orgasm and lick it off her mouth. I would lick the blood on her satin robe then I would hold her like a beautiful doll and cuddle with her until I fall asleep.==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

This practice originated from the need to discourage the men performing the funerary customs from having sexual interest in their charges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
