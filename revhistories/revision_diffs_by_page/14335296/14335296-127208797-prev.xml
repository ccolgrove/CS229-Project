  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Macon Dead]] is explaining to his son [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Milkman]] that he is disturbed by the  relationship that his wife/Milkman's mother [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Ruth Dead]] had with her father [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Dr. Foster]].  Shortly after Dr. Foster's death, Macon caught Ruth lying naked in bed with her father &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;Dr/ &lt;/span&gt;Foster's corpse, while sucking on his fingers.  It is not known whether Ruth actually had sex with the dead Dr. Foster; and Macon is believed not to have caught her in the act.  Yet, Macon seems to believe that intercourse occurred between Ruth and the corpse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
