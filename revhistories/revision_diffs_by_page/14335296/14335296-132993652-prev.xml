  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;On [[September 15]], [[2006]] a judge dismissed charges of attempted sexual assault against three men accused of trying to dig up a woman's body to have sex with the corpse, noting that Wisconsin has no law against necrophilia. Twins [[Nicholas Grunke|Nicholas]] and [[Alexander Grunke]], 20, and [[Dustin Radke]], 20, were arrested after an alleged attempt to dig up the body of 20-year-old [[Laura Tennessen]] who was killed Aug. 27 in a motorcycle crash. Officials said a caller reported suspicious activity in the cemetery Sept. 2, and deputies found someone had dug down to her vault. Radke told police that the three had stopped at a [[Wal-Mart]] on the way to the cemetery to buy condoms. Authorities said the three were not acquainted with Tennessen but had seen an obituary with her photo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
