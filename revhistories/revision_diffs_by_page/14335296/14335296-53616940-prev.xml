  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Carl Tanzler]] was a radiologist in [[Key West, Florida]] who developed a morbid obsession for Elena Milagro Hoyos (1910-1931). She was one of his patients, and she died from [[tuberculosis]] in 1931 at the hospital. With her parents' permission he had an above ground [[mausoleum]] built for her, so she wouldn't decompose underground. He visited the tomb every night and by 1933 he had taken the body home with him and kept it in his bed. He restored her body as best he could and kept a full wardrobe to dress her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Necrophilia has also been a motive for some [[serial killer]]s, including  murderers [[Ed Gein]], [[Richard Chase]], [[Winston Moseley]], [[John Reginald Halliday Christie]], [[Bruno Ludke]], [[Jerry Brudos]], and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], who ate his victims after killing them; the technical term for this particular variant activity is [[necrophagia]]. Several other [[murder]]ers have described drawing sexual excitement from killing, as well, such as [[Karla Faye Tucker]], who claimed to have an [[orgasm]] with each swing of the [[axe]] she used to kill [[Jerry Lynn Dean]]. The guilty-plea testimony provided by the recently captured ([[2005]]) serial killer [[Dennis Rader]] provided a rare public glimpse into the workings of such a controlling mind. Ballah Barco is also a known necrophiliac.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
