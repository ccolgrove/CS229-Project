The possibility of such an act taking place on a regular basis is not impossible to imagine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The second postmortem is invariably conducted at a different hospital, often necessitating the deposit of the body overnight at the mortuary of the second hospital. In cases, where the second autopsy surgeon finds signs of rape, the defendants have been known to allege that the dead body was defiled by drunk mortuary attendants at night. None of such allegations have been proved in a court of law, however.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
