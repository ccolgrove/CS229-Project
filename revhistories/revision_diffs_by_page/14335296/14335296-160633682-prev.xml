  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;In [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Macon Dead]] is explaining to his son [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Milkman]] that he is disturbed by the relationship that his wife/Milkman's mother [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Ruth Dead]] had with her father [[Song of Solomon (novel)|Dr. Foster]]. Shortly after Dr. Foster's death, Macon caught Ruth lying naked in bed with her father Dr. Foster's corpse, while sucking on his fingers. It is not known whether Ruth actually had sex with the dead Dr. Foster; and Macon is believed not to have caught her in the act. Yet, Macon seems to believe that intercourse occurred between Ruth and the corpse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
