Upon inspection, he discovered a drake (male) [[mallard]] lying dead about two meters from the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second [[drake]] mallard standing close by. As Moeliker observed the couple, the living drake picked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes and then mounted the corpse and began copulating with it.
