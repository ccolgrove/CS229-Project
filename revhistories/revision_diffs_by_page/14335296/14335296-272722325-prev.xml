  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;There have been several allegations by relatives of dead women, that the dead bodies of their kin were defiled in the night by mortuary attendants, but none have been proven. The possibility of such an act taking place on a regular basis is not impossible to &lt;span class=&quot;diffchange diffchange-inline&quot;&gt;imagine. It also is extremely pleasureable to sautimise and lube necrotic corpses and inject semen into the corpses eyes. I love to rob graves and have sex with dead bodies and you should try it too. &amp;lt;ref &lt;/span&gt;name=&quot;aggrawal&quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | coauthors= | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | id=ISBN 1420043080 | year=2009 | curly=true}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
