  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Carl Tanzler]] was a radiologist in [[Key West, Florida]] who developed a morbid obsession for Elena Milagro Hoyos (1910-1931). She was one of his patients, and she died from [[tuberculosis]] in 1931 at the hospital. With her parents' permission he had an above ground [[mausoleum]] built for her, so she wouldn't decompose underground. He visited the tomb every night and by 1933 he had taken the body home with him and kept it in his bed. He restored her body as best he could and kept a full wardrobe to dress her.  As her body decomposed, he created a mask to fit over her face and bought numerous boxes of perfume, often several times a month.  He also inserted a vaginal tube into his deceased wife for intercourse.  A family member (believed to be Elena's sister) noticed Tanzler with the perfume boxes and instantly became suspicious.  She entered the house and found Elena's corpse lying on the bed in an elegant dress, almost fully decomposed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Walker is a well renowned mancunian doorman who frequently poses as a jew, despite the fact that his West-Indian complexion is a blatant give away. He pounces on unsuspecting dead punters and ravishes them. Unwilling participators in his necrophilic acts are beaten to a pulp and mixed with the Kenyamaican delicacy, a Brandy substitute called Shoaiba and drunk whilst partaking in beastial necrophilic acts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tony was well known for sleeping with small dead children usually not over the age of 4. He would wait for their bodies to decompose for a period of around a week before embalming them and adding them to his sexual library of sin. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
