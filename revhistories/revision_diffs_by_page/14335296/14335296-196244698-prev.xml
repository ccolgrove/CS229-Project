Becoming aroused, the father has sex with the dead body. He then notices she is getting wet and is amazed that this is possible for a dead woman. When he brings his hand up it is however covered in feces. He then discovers that his penis is stuck inside her due to Rigor mortis. The mother comes out to help and rushes to the shop to buy lots of oils and vinegar. She empties the bottles into the bath with her husband and the corpse. This does not help, though, so she gives him a shot of heroin which frees him. They are both exhilarated. The Visitor has video taped the whole scene.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
