Many [[alternative rock]] artists also focus on the connection between romantic love and death, despair, and the occult; in [[Europe]], the most notable example is [[HIM (band) | Him]], and more generally the artists of the [[love metal]] movement. A comparable [[United States | American]] analogue might be [[Stabbing Westward]], a [[gothic rock]] band whose songs dealt with [[despair]], [[drug abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], [[death]], and [[romantic love]], often in conjunction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
