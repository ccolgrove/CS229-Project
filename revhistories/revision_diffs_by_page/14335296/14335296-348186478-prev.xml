  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joshua Guy is a man I play games with, he told me on several occasions that he has came close and even in contact with dead corpses. I have asked him why he would pull such disturbing stunts like that and he told me never to ask him again or he would murder me and rape me whilst I was dead. After that I got worried about Josh and even come close to reporting him to the police and psychiatric units on several different occassions on which I phoned them told them about his condition and done nothing to stop him or even prevent it from happening again. I got even more worried about Josh and even went to his home a few times to see if I could get through to him to stop this happening to anyone else in the future. I will be reporting more about Josh in the future and will tell you about the progress I have made with him, if I have made any.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
