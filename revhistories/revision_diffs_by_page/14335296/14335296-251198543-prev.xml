The evidence of necrophilia practices can be found in the artifacts of the [[Moche]] civilization of [[South America]], where pottery depicting skeletal figures engaged in [[coitus]] with living humans are among the ruins.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Even in ancient Egypt, there is record of the treatment of the bodies of young women that were set out to decompose for a few days before being delivered to embalmers. This practice originated from the need to discourage the men performing the funerary customs from having sexual interest in their charges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
