  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;An extension of the emotional connection between love and death is love for a person, which remains after death. Some [[ghost stories]] focus on a deceased person's undying love for a living individual, manifest literally in the form of a palpable [[ghost]] or [[poltergeist]]. While it is considered a romantic image for a person to die &quot;in the arms&quot; of a lover, sexual activity with the dead is usually considered [[taboo]], but has appeared in recent [[film]] and [[music]]. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
