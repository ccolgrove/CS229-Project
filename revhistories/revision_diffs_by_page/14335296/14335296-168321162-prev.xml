  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;[[Carl Tanzler]] was a [[radiologist]] in [[Key West, Florida]] who developed a morbid obsession for Elena Milagro Hoyos (1910-1931). She was one of his patients, and she died from [[tuberculosis]] in 1931. With her parents' permission, Tanzler had an above ground [[mausoleum]] built for her, so she wouldn't decompose underground. He visited the tomb almost every night, but in 1933, his obsession apparently overcame him, as he took Hoyos' corpse home with him and kept it in his bed. He restored her body as best he could and kept a full wardrobe to dress her. As her body decomposed, he replaced the skin with wax and [[plaster of Paris]], and bought copious amounts of perfume, often several times a month. In 1940, one of Hoyos's surviving sisters became suspicious due to omnipresent rumors of Tanzler's necrophilia, and eventually confronted Tanzler at his home. She entered Tanzler's house and found Elena's corpse lying in his bed in an elegant dress, almost fully decomposed. Tanzler was later arrested and charged with &quot;wantonly and maliciously destroying a grave and removing a body without authorization,&quot; but he was ultimately released, as the [[statute of limitations]] on the crime had expired.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
