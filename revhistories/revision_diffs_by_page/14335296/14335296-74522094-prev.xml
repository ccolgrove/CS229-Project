  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-deletedline&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Necrophilia is not unknown in animals, with a number of confirmed observations. [[Kees Moeliker]] made one of these observations while he was sitting in his office at the [[Natuurmuseum Rotterdam]], when he heard the distinctive thud of a bird hitting the glass facade of the building. Upon inspection, he discovered a drake mallard lying dead about two meters from the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second drake mallard standing close by. As he observed the odd couple, the living drake picked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes and then mounted the corpse and began [[copulating]] with it. The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior. Moeliker surmised that at the time of the collision with the window the two mallards were engaged in a common motif in [[duck]] behavior which is called [[rape flight]]. &quot;When one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback -- well, didn't get any feedback,&quot; according to Moeliker. This is the first recorded case of [[necrophilia in the mallard duck]].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
