  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Antiquity offers numerous examples of what may readily be described as cults of thanatophilia; perhaps the most famous of them being that of [[Alexander the Great]]'s, which was centered around his supposed [[breastplate]], which was kept in its very own [[mausoleum]] in the [[eponymous]] Egyptian city for over five hundred years. More remarkable still are accounts stating that Alexander's body was placed in a [[sarcophagus]] of solid gold and perfectly preserved in a (sterilizing) bath of honey through the remaining centuries of antiquity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
