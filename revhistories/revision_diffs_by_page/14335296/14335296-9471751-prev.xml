  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A sexual act with a corpse is generally considered socially unacceptable; the presumption being that the person would not have consented to the act while alive, it amounts to the [[rape]] of a dead body. Virtually all human [[society | societies]] condemn abuse of the dead. However, in rare cases, necrophiliac acts can be consensual: for example, in the [[Armin Meiwes]] case, the victim gave his consent to the mutilation and death inflicted upon him. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Necrophilia has at times been employed as a subject matter in films, novels, music ect... The controversial German film ''[[Nekromantik]]'' deals graphically with the subject, also the [[Canadian]] film ''Kissed'' is about a woman who works in a morgue and finds herself erotically drawn to the corpses she deals with. In the 1970's, shock rocker [[Alice Cooper]] recorded a couple of songs about necrophilia, one entitled &quot;I love the dead&quot;, and the other called &quot;Cold ethyl&quot;. In the 80's and 90's necrophilia was often a subject of songs in the [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] genres. In the [[1993]] music video for [[Tom Petty]]'s hit song &quot;Last dance with Mary-Jane&quot; Petty is seen in various romantic poses with a dead woman (played by [[Kim Bassinger]]).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
