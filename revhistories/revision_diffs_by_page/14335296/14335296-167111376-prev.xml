  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;The practice of necrophilia has a long history. Necrophilia was practiced in some ancient cultures as a spiritual means of communicating with the dead, while others employed it as an attempt to revive the recently departed. The evidence of necrophilia practices can be found in the artifacts of the [[Moche]] civilization of South America, where pottery depicting skeletal figures engaged in coitus with living humans are among the ruins. Even in ancient Egypt, there is record of the treatment of the bodies of young women that were set out to rot for a few days before being delivered to embalmers. This practice was born from the need to discourage the men performing the funerary customs from having sexual interest in their charges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;diff-context&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Antiquity offers numerous examples of what may readily be described as cults of thanatophilia; perhaps the most famous of them being that of [[Alexander the Great]]'s, which was physically centered around his [[breastplate]], kept in a [[mausoleum|mausolean]] reliquary in the [[eponymous]] Egyptian city for over five hundred years. More remarkable still are accounts stating that Alexander's body was placed in a [[sarcophagus]] of solid gold and perfectly preserved in a (sterilizing) bath of honey through the remaining centuries of antiquity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
