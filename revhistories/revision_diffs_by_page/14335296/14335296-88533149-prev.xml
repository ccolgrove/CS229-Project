Shortly after Dr. Foster's death, Macon caught Ruth lying in bed, naked, with her father's corpse, while sucking on his fingers.  It is not known whether she actually had sex with the dead Dr. Foster, and Macon is believed not to have caught her in the act.  Yet, Macon seems to believe that intercourse occured between Ruth and the corpse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
